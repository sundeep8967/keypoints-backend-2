The Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for south-east England as more than a month's worth of rain is forecast to fall in a matter of hours on Saturday morning. It says fast-flowing and deep floodwaters are likely, leading to road and transport disruption, as well as power cuts. The warning for torrential downpours come days after a third UK heatwave of the year that parched swathes of the UK and led to several hosepipe bans being declared.",

Liverpool Crown Court heard the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officers entered Terminal 2 car park's pay station area on 23 July 2024 after reports that a male fitting Mr Amaaz's description had just headbutted a member of the public. Prosecutors say Mr Amaaz resisted arrest while Muhammad Amaad, 26, intervened, with both allegedly subjecting police to a \"high level of violence\".",

A five-day search along the Thames, completed on Friday, found 115 young swans, rather than 86 last year, showing signs that the disappearance of swans could be starting to be reversed. The traditional count is called \"swan upping\", but in recent years it has been more like swan downing, with numbers plunging due to avian flu and human cruelty, including reports of swans being attacked by catapults and air guns. But the new figures released by the King's swan marker, David Barber, show a more optimistic picture, after a 45% fall over the past two years.",

After analyzing the Expel write-up, I’m confident that the attack doesn’t bypass FIDO protections, at least not in the sense that the word “bypass” is commonly used in security circles. Rather, the attack downgrades the MFA process to a weaker, non-FIDO-based process.",

          "description": "Researchers from Cisco’s Talos security team have uncovered a malware-as-a-service operator that used public GitHub accounts as a channel for distributing an assortment of malicious software to targets. The use of GitHub gave the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) a reliable and easy-to-use platform that’s greenlit in many enterprise networks that rely on the code repository for the software they develop. GitHub removed the three accounts that hosted the malicious payloads shortly after being notified by Talos. “In addition to being an easy means of file hosting, downloading files from a GitHub repository may bypass Web filtering that is not configured to block the GitHub domain,” Talos researchers Chris Neal and Craig Jacksonwrote Thursday.",

Not one that asks for permission to share personal information, or potential malware, but something far more serious: There's an earthquake nearby, and you have up to a minute or two to get to a safer location. Starting in the US in 2020 and expanding internationally since, the system is called Android Earthquake Alert (AEA), and it's on by default in most Android phones. And today, Google has a paper in Science that describes how the system works, how the company has improved it, and what it has seen during the first few years of operation, including what caused a handful of false alarms.",

Some are made from medical waste, like dried bits of discarded placentas or infant foreskin, and many have not gone through rigorous testing to prove they offer any advantage over standard bandages. Yet, in some cases, Medicare reportedly paid for bandages priced at more than $21,000 per square inch. And individual patients have quickly racked up bills over $1 million just for their bandaging—some who puzzlingly didn't even have a wound.",

The Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for south-east England as more than a month's worth of rain is forecast to fall in a matter of hours on Saturday morning. It says fast-flowing and deep floodwaters are likely, leading to road and transport disruption, as well as power cuts. The warning for torrential downpours come days after a third UK heatwave of the year that parched swathes of the UK and led to several hosepipe bans being declared.",

A five-day search along the Thames, completed on Friday, found 115 young swans, rather than 86 last year, showing signs that the disappearance of swans could be starting to be reversed. The traditional count is called \"swan upping\", but in recent years it has been more like swan downing, with numbers plunging due to avian flu and human cruelty, including reports of swans being attacked by catapults and air guns. But the new figures released by the King's swan marker, David Barber, show a more optimistic picture, after a 45% fall over the past two years.",

The winger came up with two tries in the first half to fend off a combative Salford side who replied through Ryan Brierley and had an equalising try disallowed for obstruction as they competed well at Headingley.

After analyzing the Expel write-up, I’m confident that the attack doesn’t bypass FIDO protections, at least not in the sense that the word “bypass” is commonly used in security circles.

Archaeologist Anaëlle Jallon of Hebrew University of Jerusalem and her colleagues examined dozens of animal bones from both sites, looking for clues about Neanderthal meal prep. It turns out that something as mundane as the cut marks left by butchering an animal can reveal differences in ancient people’s way of life.",

The law provides a federal framework for stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that's considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, as each token is backed by the US dollar or other supposedly low-risk assets. The GENIUS Act is expected to spur more widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, since stablecoins are often used to move funds between different tokens.",

A five-day search along the Thames, completed on Friday, found 115 young swans, rather than 86 last year, showing signs that the disappearance of swans could be starting to be reversed. The traditional count is called \"swan upping\", but in recent years it has been more like swan downing, with numbers plunging due to avian flu and human cruelty, including reports of swans being attacked by catapults and air guns. But the new figures released by the King's swan marker, David Barber, show a more optimistic picture, after a 45% fall over the past two years.",

If true, the attack,reported in a blog post Thursdayby security firm Expel, would be huge news, since FIDO is widely regarded as being immune to credential phishing attacks. After analyzing the Expel write-up, I’m confident that the attack doesn’t bypass FIDO protections, at least not in the sense that the word “bypass” is commonly used in security circles. Rather, the attack downgrades the MFA process to a weaker, non-FIDO-based process.",

Starting in the US in 2020 and expanding internationally since, the system is called Android Earthquake Alert (AEA), and it's on by default in most Android phones. And today, Google has a paper in Science that describes how the system works, how the company has improved it, and what it has seen during the first few years of operation, including what caused a handful of false alarms.",

The winger came up with two tries in the first half to fend off a combative Salford side who replied through Ryan Brierley and had an equalising try disallowed for obstruction as they competed well at Headingley. Leeds ironed out the errors and Salford ran out of steam in the second half as the Rhinos stretched clear. Lachie Miller went over, Edgell grabbed his third and Harry Newman, James McDonnell and Cooper Jenkins piled on the tries.",

A five-day search along the Thames, completed on Friday, found 115 young swans, rather than 86 last year, showing signs that the disappearance of swans could be starting to be reversed. The traditional count is called \"swan upping\", but in recent years it has been more like swan downing, with numbers plunging due to avian flu and human cruelty, including reports of swans being attacked by catapults and air guns. But the new figures released by the King's swan marker, David Barber, show a more optimistic picture, after a 45% fall over the past two years.",

The search-focused AI startup is rapidly adding millions of users in the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market, positioning itself for mass-market scale. This week, Perplexitypartnered with Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator after Reliance Jio, to offer a free 12-month Perplexity Pro subscription — normally worth $200 — to all 360 million Airtel subscribers. Airtel confirmed to TechCrunch that the deal is exclusive, meaning no other telco in the country can offer Perplexity’s services, including free access, to their subscribers.",

After analyzing the Expel write-up, I’m confident that the attack doesn’t bypass FIDO protections, at least not in the sense that the word “bypass” is commonly used in security circles. Rather, the attack downgrades the MFA process to a weaker, non-FIDO-based process.",

        "description": "Last year, Medicare spent over $10 billion on dubious bandages—called skin substitutes—that come with eye-popping prices. Some are made from medical waste, like dried bits of discarded placentas or infant foreskin, and many have not gone through rigorous testing to prove they offer any advantage over standard bandages. Yet, in some cases, Medicare reportedly paid for bandages priced at more than $21,000 per square inch. And individual patients have quickly racked up bills over $1 million just for their bandaging—some who puzzlingly didn't even have a wound.",

The update merges capabilities from OpenAI's earlierOperatortool and theDeep Researchfeature, allowing ChatGPT to navigate websites, run code, and create documents while users maintain control over the process. The feature marks OpenAI's latest entry into what the tech industry calls \"agentic AI\"—systems that can take autonomous multi-step actions on behalf of the user. OpenAI says users can ask Agent to handle requests like assembling and purchasing a clothing outfit for a particular occasion, creating PowerPoint slide decks, planning meals, or updating financial spreadsheets with new data.",

The winger came up with two tries in the first half to fend off a combative Salford side who replied through Ryan Brierley and had an equalising try disallowed for obstruction as they competed well at Headingley. Leeds ironed out the errors and Salford ran out of steam in the second half as the Rhinos stretched clear. Lachie Miller went over, Edgell grabbed his third and Harry Newman, James McDonnell and Cooper Jenkins piled on the tries.",

First-half scores from Ewan Ashman, Rory Hutchinson, Arron Reed and Kyle Steyn had Gregor Townsend's side in a commanding position, before further scores from Grant Gilchrist, Kyle Rowe and George Turner in the second period. Ben Nee-Nee and a determined Duncan Paia'aua were able to get two back for the hosts at Eden Park, but Scotland dominated all areas in a much more proficient and disciplined performance. That was despite missing almost a full starting XV to either injury or British and Irish Lions duty.",
