In the space of nine overs, Zimbabwe lost four wickets for 19 runs© AFP/Getty Images From June 1999 to February 2004, Bangladesh had racked up some unwanted records - most consecutive defeats in international cricket, which included most consecutive Test defeats, the longest winless streak in that format, and the most consecutive ODI defeats. Now under a new captain, Bangladesh were hoping for better days. Habibul Bashar, Bangladesh captain:The Zimbabwe team was far ahead of us in those days, that too in their conditions. We had already lost the Test series. Imade a pair in my first Test as captain. While we waited for the rain to stop in Bulawayo [where the first two ODIs had to be abandoned], coachDav Whatmorewas trying to instil the mentality of trying to win rather than thinking about playing well and losing - he would tell us that there was no glory in that. Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh batsman:One day on the tour, I was telling Shuvrobhai[journalist Utpal Shuvro] that the Bangladesh public treats us as heroes even though we don't win any matches. We have such a wonderful following despite our results.",

        "description": "An alleged serial killer who met his victims on dating apps before savagely robbing and killing them had a lengthy California crime history thatincluded wearing a white-face mask to hide his black identity, authorities revealed.Prosecutors charged 34-year-old Rockim Prowell on Monday for robbing and killing two men he met on dating apps in 2021 and 2023.He allegedly also attacked a third victim in February of this year, tying him up, beating him with a baseball bat, and stealing his wallet.Cops found the mask after pulling Prowell over in a car linked to the crimes.It is unclear whether Prowell wore the ghoulish face when he allegedly seduced, robbed and murdered 51-year-old Miguel Angel King and 53-year-old Robert Gutierrez in 2021 and 2023, respectively — before fleeing the scene in their cars.King was found dumped in the Angeles National Forest, with a fatal bullet wound. Authorities never located Gutierrez’s body, but his car was discovered in Prowell’s garage, authorities claim.Prowell, of Inglewood, was already on probation for two burglary convictions between 2019 and 2021, but cops saidhe was likely linked to as many as 30 break-ins across Los Angeles.The deranged criminal attempted to avoid detection during the spree by sporting a creepy rubber mask that made him look like a young, white man, security footage reported by FOX 11 confirmed. The creep allegedly tied up and tortured a third man, Jordan Andrews, 40, in February of this year — beating him viciuosly with a baseball bat.Andrews managed to escape, but Prowell rammed him with a car as the victim fled, breaking his leg, prosecutors said.***(Excerpt) Read more atnypost.com...TOPICS:Crime/Corruption;Culture/Society;News/Current EventsKEYWORDS:blacks;crime;donate2freerepublic;racistsClick here:to donate by Credit CardOr here:to donate by PayPalOr by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794Thank you very much and God bless you.Navigation:use the links below to view more comments.first1...",

        "description": "“Morning Joe” noted that the outlet that has been consistently breaking news on Donald Trump’s relationship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein despite the president’s claims of a “Democrat hoax” is conservative media tycoon Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal. Host Joe Scarborough lambasted Trump’s claims on Tuesday’s episode, noting the Journal’s persistence in revealing new aspects of Trump and Epstein’s questionable dynamics. The Wall Street Journal wasthe first outletto report on Trump’s sexually suggestive letter to Epstein for the latter’s 50th birthday in 2003, prompting a$10 billion libel lawsuit from the president. On Monday, WSJ published a photo of the letter in full on Monday after the House Oversight Committee obtained a copy of it from Epstein’s estate. “It is now, again, safely, the most conservative, the most powerful conservative media organization on the planet – they are the ones who have broken this story,” Scarborough said. “They are the ones who have continued reporting on this story. It is Rupert Murdoch’s own conservative media empire that is running this, not Democrats, not a Democratic hoax, not a left-wing CBS News edit or whatever they would want to say.” Still, the White House hasrepeatedlytried to claim the signature on the letter is a forgery, highlightingrecent examplesof Trump’s signature. Trump alsoclaimedon Tuesday that the issue was a “dead issue.” But letters from the same time period as the Epstein letter showed signatures that matched Trump’s, which the Journal highlighted in itsMonday report. “This is straight out of the Murdoch empire, all of it,” Scarborough said.

        "description": "ThePhiladelphia Phillieshave had an eventful season, but no story has dominated headlines quite like the \"Phillies Karen\" incident from Friday night's game against theMiami Marlins. A Harrison Bader home run landed in the left field stands, and after a scramble for the ball, a father picked it up and gave it to his son. A woman, who was dubbed \"Phillies Karen,\" followed the father, demanding the ball, and eventually got it before walking away. The moment went viral, and in the days since, various false claims have surfaced regarding the woman's identity and the background of the father and son who lost the home run ball. But another claim surfaced recently on Facebook, which claimed that Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie is banning \"Phillies Karen\" from Eagles games for her actions. The viral social media post onFacebook from Bleed Green Dailystated the following: \"BREAKING NEWS: Jeffrey Lurie - CEO of Philadelphia Eagles - just shocked the sports community when he announced that he would 'permanently ban' the woman dubbed 'Phillies Karen' from entering Lincoln Financial Field. In addition, he sent a warning to the entire Eagles sports fan community: 'Anyone who is competitive, aggressive, and disregards mutual respect - like the woman in the recent incident...\" This claim isn't supported by a video or an official source. It's an unsubstantiated claim from an unknown source, similar to the other claims made surrounding the \"Phillies Karen\" incident, which are not real. Simply put, Lurie never made this comment or the decision to ban \"Phillies Karen\" from Eagles games. Surprisingly, this isn't the first time that the Eagles have been linked to \"Phillies Karen\" either.",

The device, named the iPhone Air, is one of several upgrades the company unveiled at its annual product showcase, promoted with the title “awe-dropping”. The event kicked off at 10am PT with the company’s CEO, Tim Cook, speaking in front of its Cupertino headquarters. “Design is at the core of everything we do,” Cook said. The CEO touted the company’s thin iPhone, which sports a width of 5.6mm, as the “biggest leap ever” for the device, which first debuted in 2007. Cook said that Apple had set a “new standard” for the gadget industry back then and “today we’re raising the bar once again” with its iPhone 17 lineup. The skinny phone is made of “spacecraft titanium”, has a 6.5in display and comes in a palette of colors that “evoke lightness”, the company says. Apple executives who spoke at Tuesday’s event promised that, despite the phone’s thinness, it will be durable and crack-resistant. They added that the phone also comes with the same fast-charging battery, wifi and features as its thicker phones. The iPhone Air will retail for $999, with preorders starting on Friday in advance of general availability on 19 September.",

This has also made Africa the cradle of climate solutions for the world,” said President Ruto, indicating that with AAAP 2.0 there is the opportunity “not just to protect our environment, the climate, but to propel our development, and also generate jobs and attract investment. We call on our partners across the world to join us in this major new effort under CAHOSCC,” President Ruto added. The call for AAAP 2.0 was made during the Africa Climate Summit’s mandated event, “Scaling Africa’s Adaptation Action,” co-hosted by the Government of Ethiopia and GCA, with attendance from leaders of Kenya, Ghana, and Zambia, as well as representatives from the African Union, International Financial Institutions, key development partners and African nations. Leaders at the ACS event highlighted that with the world on the brink of surpassing the 1.5°C threshold, Africa—being the most climate-vulnerable continent—must respond urgently to protect its people and economies. As such, AAAP 2.0 would aim to build on the success of the first phase, which embedded adaptation into $25 billion of investments, benefitting over 200 million people across 40 African nations, and supporting the creation of more than 1 million jobs. A new Global Center on Adaptation (GCA)–Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) report shows how the newly positioned AAAP 2.0 initiative under CAHOSCC could help take Africa into the “high-upside” scenario, where private sector leadership, innovation, and resilient economic growth converge.

And not only that, forest expansion actually increased agricultural output in the study. “When you go back and reforest, it’s not going to eat into agricultural resources.” These findings can help governments, policymakers, and conservation organizations more accurately assess the costs and benefits of forest expansion projects in the fight against climate change. “The key policy implication is that there may be co-benefits to using forest expansion as a tool to sequester carbon,” says Matthew E. Oliver, associate professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Economics and coauthor on the paper. Without accounting for them, the net social benefits may be significantly underestimated, the researchers write. The findings could also suggest alternative paths for aid organizations, Oliver says.",

        "description": "The primary sector in India provides employment to 44 per cent of the labour force while contributing less than 20 per cent to the country’s GDP. The primary sector is defined as the economic sector that produces goods by exploiting natural resources like land, water, forests, mines, etc. Agriculture is one of the most important primary sectors. However, while agriculture’s share in employment has fallen slowly, its share in GDP has declined relatively faster. It underlinesthe slow nature of structural transformation of the Indian economy. As a result, agriculture is no longer the primary driving force of the economy. What remains hidden, though, is theroleof the non-agricultural primary sector in most discussions on the Indian economy..",

        "description": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that she is confident of GST rate cuts passing through to the end consumers, and has trust in the industry and traders. Speaking at the NDTV Profit GST Conclave, Sitharaman said that taxable items were viewed from the lens of daily consumption, aspirational items for the middle class, for farmers, and items which are important to the Indian economy at large. All 140 crore Indians will have something or the other where the tax reduction will come through, she assured. GST 2.0 was in the making for almost 1.5 years, Sitharaman said, adding that she was waiting for a worthy pack of reforms before presenting the overhaul. While thanking ministers from multiple parties and states who acceded to the reforms, she noted that the GST Council meeting was not at all acrimonious. The council is accustomed to discussion of this nature, she said, but clarified that the decision to bring down the rates saw no opposition from anyone. The difference was on the path of revenue falling, the finance minister said. On that, she said that Centre and states are together, with both seeing the impact. As such, efficiency will have to increase to offset the fall, she added..",

        "description": "The rising farm indebtedness needs urgent policy attention Indian agricultural indebtedness has remained a cause for concern over the decades, despite the remarkable growth in agricultural production. But, its surge in recent years, particularly post Covid-19, calls for immediate measures to safeguard the livelihoods of agricultural households, amid growing tariff pressures threatening to disrupt supply chains, in addition to the existing myriad problems affecting the farm sector. Unlike the farmers in US with an average farm size of about 189 hectares, Indian farmers with an average farm size of 0.74 hectares, produce crops under extremely unfavourable conditions with low scale of economies and fragile incomes and hence end up incurring debt..",

In the space of nine overs, Zimbabwe lost four wickets for 19 runs© AFP/Getty Images From June 1999 to February 2004, Bangladesh had racked up some unwanted records - most consecutive defeats in international cricket, which included most consecutive Test defeats, the longest winless streak in that format, and the most consecutive ODI defeats. Now under a new captain, Bangladesh were hoping for better days. Habibul Bashar, Bangladesh captain:The Zimbabwe team was far ahead of us in those days, that too in their conditions. We had already lost the Test series. Imade a pair in my first Test as captain. While we waited for the rain to stop in Bulawayo [where the first two ODIs had to be abandoned], coachDav Whatmorewas trying to instil the mentality of trying to win rather than thinking about playing well and losing - he would tell us that there was no glory in that. Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh batsman:One day on the tour, I was telling Shuvrobhai[journalist Utpal Shuvro] that the Bangladesh public treats us as heroes even though we don't win any matches. We have such a wonderful following despite our results.",

The primary sector is defined as the economic sector that produces goods by exploiting natural resources like land, water, forests, mines, etc. Agriculture is one of the most important primary sectors. However, while agriculture’s share in employment has fallen slowly, its share in GDP has declined relatively faster. It underlinesthe slow nature of structural transformation of the Indian economy. As a result, agriculture is no longer the primary driving force of the economy. What remains hidden, though, is theroleof the non-agricultural primary sector in most discussions on the Indian economy..",

        "description": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that she is confident of GST rate cuts passing through to the end consumers, and has trust in the industry and traders. Speaking at the NDTV Profit GST Conclave, Sitharaman said that taxable items were viewed from the lens of daily consumption, aspirational items for the middle class, for farmers, and items which are important to the Indian economy at large. All 140 crore Indians will have something or the other where the tax reduction will come through, she assured. GST 2.0 was in the making for almost 1.5 years, Sitharaman said, adding that she was waiting for a worthy pack of reforms before presenting the overhaul. While thanking ministers from multiple parties and states who acceded to the reforms, she noted that the GST Council meeting was not at all acrimonious. The council is accustomed to discussion of this nature, she said, but clarified that the decision to bring down the rates saw no opposition from anyone. The difference was on the path of revenue falling, the finance minister said. On that, she said that Centre and states are together, with both seeing the impact. As such, efficiency will have to increase to offset the fall, she added..",
