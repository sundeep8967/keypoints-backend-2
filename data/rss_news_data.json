        "description": "Eminent Nepalese jurist Sushila Karki, who has emerged as a probable face to lead an interim government in the violence-wracked Himalayan nation, is a former chief justice who carries a reputation for a no-nonsense, anti-corruption stance. While she lacks political and executive experience, it‚Äôs this anti-graft reputation that has prompted Nepal‚Äôs Gen Z protesters to put forward her name as interim prime minister. While the immediate trigger for the violent protests, that left 19 people dead, was a social media ban, tensions have long simmered over corruption, a stagnating economy and a lack of jobs..",

For Apple, this new iPhone is coming in place of the iPhone Plus models that have been in vogue for years. But unlike those larger iPhones, this one also offers access to the Pro processor range of Apple silicon. WhileApplethinks the phone will cater to those who needa thin and light iPhone with Pro features, the device puts it in a strange position, especially in price-conscious markets like India. Consumers will ask if this is a larger iPhone or a cheaper iPhone Pro. But when compared to basic iPhones, this has just one camera, though the price is more than the regular iPhone. Then this will be catering to those who want a more powerful and slim device, but are not really too bothered by its camera capabilities..",

Investors Exantia and Invest-NL lead the round. Today, a majority of the world‚Äôs lithium-ion batteries, and the graphite anodes within them, are made in China. Silicon anodes couldupend that relationshipwhile also dramatically improving the performance of lithium-ion batteries. While slow-and-steady advancements have doubled their energy densityover the past decade, LeydenJar says its pure silicon anodes can give them a 50% boost over traditional graphite anodes. Battery manufacturers have long known this, but silicon‚Äôs delicate nature has kept them from incorporating large amounts. Silicon tends to swell when storing lithium ions, and without some structure to support it, it will crumble quickly with successive charge cycles. To compensate, silicon anode startups have devised various scaffolds to keep things from breaking down.

        "description": "The co-founders whosold their last startup Anchor to Spotifyare launching their next project:Oboe, an AI-powered educational app that enables anyone to create lightweight, flexible learning courses on nearly any topic they choose, simply by entering a prompt. These courses can span a variety of verticals, including topics like science, history, foreign language, news, pop culture, preparing for life changes, and more. At launch, Oboe ‚Äî a name inspired by the root of the Japanesewordmeaning ‚Äúto learn‚Äù ‚Äî will offer nine different course formats. These allow users to learn in the way they prefer, Oboe co-founderNir Zichermanexplained to TechCrunch. Zicherman founded the company along with Anchor co-founderMichael Mignanoafter leaving Spotify in October 2023 and taking a brief period to recharge. Zicherman said he was inspired to work on an AI educational product after working to scale Spotify‚Äôs audiobooks business, which made it easier for people to gain access to high-quality and educational content, as it was bundled with their music subscription. Unlike AI chatbots, you don‚Äôt have to engage in back-and-forth conversations to learn with Oboe. Instead, you can opt for text and visuals, audio courses, games, interactive tests, and more. For those who want to learn on the go, Oboe offers two audio formats. One feels more like listening to a university-style lecture, while the other is akin to Google‚Äôs podcast-like Notebook LM, as it features two hosts talking in depth about the topic.",

        "description": "Apple's most famous chips are the A- and M-series processors that power its iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but this year, its effort to build its own wireless chips is starting to bear fruit. Earlier this spring, the iPhone 16e included Apple's C1 modem, furthering Apple's ambitions to shed its dependence on Qualcomm, and today's iPhone Air brought a faster Apple C1X variant, plus something new: the Apple N1, a chip that provides Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support for all of today's new iPhones. Apple didn't dive deep into the capabilities of the N1, or why it had switched from using third-party suppliers (historically, Apple has mostly leaned on Broadcom for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). However, the company's press releases say that it should make Continuity features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop more reliable‚Äîthese features use Bluetooth for initial communication and then Wi-Fi to establish a high-speed local link between two devices. Other features that use a similar combination of wireless technologies, like using an iPad as an extended Mac display, should also benefit. These aren't Apple's first chips to integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth technology. The Apple Watches rely on W-series chips to provide their Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity; the Apple H1 and H2 chips also provide Bluetooth connectivity for many of Apple's wireless headphones. But this is the first time that Apple has switched to its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip in one of its iPhones, suggesting that the chips have matured enough to provide higher connectivity speeds for more demanding devices. Apple will likely expand the use of the N1 (and other N-series chips) beyond the iPhone soon enough. Macs and iPads are obvious candidates, but the presence of Thread support also suggests that we'll see it in new smart home devices like the Apple TV or HomePod..",

        "description": "Reddit has addressed a problem where the description of subreddits originally written by moderators appeared different‚Äîand, often, inaccurate‚Äîon Reddit‚Äôs Android app. For weeks, the problem was largely suspected to be caused by Reddit clumsily using generative AI to create new subreddit descriptions. However, Reddit says that the changes were the fault of a bug tied to its AI-powered translation technology. Reports of subreddits suddenly having inaccurate summaries when viewed on Reddit‚Äôs Android app started surfacing on Reddita couple of weeks ago. On August 29, a moderatorreportedon the r/ModSupport subreddit for moderators that the r/ThronesAndDominions subreddit's description changed from ‚ÄúThe wayward adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe crazy adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth.‚Äù The problem got more attention when r/actuallesbians‚Äô Android app descriptiondescribedthe community as ‚Äúa place for straight and transgender lesbians ‚Ä¶‚Äù instead of ‚Äúa place for cis and trans lesbians ‚Ä¶‚Äù Other complaintsfollowed, including from r/autisticparents, a subreddit for parents with autism whose descriptionwas changedto say that it is a group for ‚Äúparents of autistic children.‚Äù A moderator who asked to be referred to by their Reddit username, Paige_Railstone, described the confusion that the changes brought to their subreddit: Many of our subreddit‚Äôs users have seen their communities get overrun time and time again, so it is completely understandable that there would be a great deal of panic and concern when it became apparent that the description had been changed. Today, a Reddit admin, going by redtaboo on the site, apologized andofferedan explanation for the inaccurate subreddit descriptions, saying that \"a bug with our translation service took to translating from [E]nglish to [E]nglish.\" Explaining further to Ars, Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt said: There was a small bug in a test we ran that mistakenly caused the English-to-English trans...",

        "description": "CUPERTINO, Calif.‚ÄîWe're a long way from the days when a new iPhone launch just meant one new phone. It shifted to \"basically the same phone in two sizes\" a decade or so ago, and then to a version of \"one lineup of regular phones and one lineup of Pro phones\" in 2017 when the iPhone 8 was introduced next to the iPhone X. But thanks to Apple's newly introduced iPhone Air, the iPhone 17 lineup gives new phone buyers more choices and trade-offs than they've ever had before. Apple's phones are now available in a spectrum of sizes, weights, speeds, costs, and camera configurations. And while options are great to have, it also means you need to know more about which one to pick. We've gone hands-on with all four of Apple's new phones, and while more extensive tire-kicking will be required, we can at least try to nail down exactly what kind of person each of these phones is for. There's no more iPhone mini, and there's no more iPhone Plus. Now we have an iPhone Air, and it is very much its own thing. The phone is just over two-thirds the thickness of the iPhone 17, not counting what Apple now calls a \"camera plateau\" that stretches across the top of the device. It's 0.22 inches thick and weighs 5.82 ounces, compared to 0.31 inches thick and 6.24 ounces for the iPhone 17.",

The positive results come asAmericans face a confusing, state-by-state patchwork of access to the shotsunder health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an ardent anti-vaccine activist who has unilaterally restricted access. Prior to the second Trump administration, all Americans ages 6 months and older had access to the vaccines. But under Kennedy, the Food and Drug Administration limited COVID-19 vaccine approvals to people 65 and older, and people under 64 years only if they have an underlying medical condition. In Pfizer and BioNTech's latest trial, the companies limited enrollment to these groups. The phase 3 trial included 100 people total, 50 people age 65 or older and 50 people age 18 to 64 with an underlying condition.Those conditionsincluded asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, HIV, mental health conditions, Parkinson's disease, obesity, or smoking. All participants had gotten last season's COVID shot at least six months prior to the trial and had not gotten any other COVID-19 vaccines or a COVID-19 infection since then. This year's Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine targets the SARS-CoV-2 strain LP.8.1, a variant in the JN.1 family. In both age groups in the trial, the LP.8.1 vaccines boosted LP.8.1-neutralizing antibody levels by at least fourfold, on average.",

This has altered global student mobility. According to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), nearly 80% of Indian student visa applications were rejected in 2025. Indian students comprise around 40% of Canada's international students. Four out of five Indian applicants received refusals in the second quarter of 2025, education outletThe PIE Newsreported, citing figures from BorderPass. As per data from the Canadian government, 1.88 lakh Indian students were admitted in 2024. This number was more than double two years ago. While Ottawa hasn't shared a country-wise breakdown, The PIE News reported that the high rejection rate is affecting students across Asia, Africa and beyond, showing how Canada is changing its approach to international education. For decades, North America was the default choice for many students drawn by safety, opportunity and world-class institutions. But recent figures point to a major shift.",

Lecornu is set to take office on Wednesday just asFrance saw widespread protestsled by a left-wing grassroots movement known as \"Block Everything\" (Bloquons tout). Analysts say Lecornu faces a baptism of fire, faced with a twin challenge - managing a politically fractured parliament and a highly mobilised public against the government's spending cuts and austerity measures. In Rennes, demonstrators set a bus on fire and caused damage to a power line in the southwest. Around200 arrests have taken place so far, authorities said. The \"Block Everything\" collective is a citizen-led movement calling for boycott, civil disobedience, and solidarity in response to government policies. Unlike traditional strikes led by unions or political parties, the movement is independent, organised primarily through social media platforms such as X, TikTok, Telegram, and Facebook. Supporters are using hashtags like #10septembre2025 and #10septembre to spread their message, encouraging actions such as: Although the protests did not fully achieve their self-declared goal of \"blocking everything,\" they caused widespread disruption and showed growing public anger. The immediate trigger is Francois Bayrou's 2026 budget, which proposes: Even before September 10, the protests caused significant disruption across the country. Demonstrators attempted to block highways in Bordeaux, while a cable fire in Toulouse affected rail traffic.",

The anti-graft protests in Nepal have killed at least 19 civilians and three security personnel this week as an angry mob vandalised government buildings and chased politicians on the streets. The demonstrations were organised by the group \"Gen Z Nepal\" and drew support from more than half the Himalayan nation's 30 million people who are younger than 30, but often led by prime ministers twice their age. Started as Ms Gill said a large group of protestors attacked the hotel where she was staying and burned the place down. She said the mob did not even spare tourists and chased them on the streets with sticks in hand. \"My name is Upasana Gill, and I am sending this video to Praful Garg. I request the Indian embassy to please help us. All those who can help us, please help.",

        "description": "Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that if someone does not feel proud seeing the grand temple at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya, then their being Indian itself is doubtful.The chief minister was speaking at a weekly tribute ceremony marking the 56th death anniversary of Mahant Digvijaynath and the 11th death anniversary of Mahant Avaidyanath at the Gorakhnath temple premises. \"Today, who in India would not feel proud seeing the grand temple at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya? If someone does not, then their being Indian itself is doubtful,\" Mr Adityanath said. He said Mahant Digvijaynath had resolved to remove the symbols of slavery and dreamt of building a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya by removing the disputed structure there. \"Today, that dream of both Mahant Digvijaynath and Mahant Avaidyanath has been fulfilled,\" he said. Quoting a Sanskrit line, Mr Adityanath said every individual has potential and only needs the right guidance. He praised the two late mahants for guiding society and the nation through their commitment and sacrifice, dedicating their lives to the country and religion. Mr Adityanath also said that a saint regards society as his family and the nation as his clan, with his only identity being Sanatan Dharma. \"When a true saint takes a vow, its results are bound to be seen,\" he said, adding that \"the Ram temple stands as a testimony to the mahants' determination and struggle.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

        "description": "The extradition proceeding against diamantaire Mehul Choksi, wanted in the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case, is likely to commence in a Belgian court next Monday, officials said. The court hearings will be led by Belgian federal prosecutors, with support from the CBI and India's Ministry of External Affairs. Choksi is understood to have held residency in Belgium since 2023, having relocated to the European country from Antigua and Barbuda for medical treatment, officials said, adding that his wife is a Belgian national. The CBI had received information of his presence in Belgium in January 2024, following which an extradition request was dispatched to the European country with which India had signed a treaty in 2020, making it the first case under the arrangement, they said. Based on India's request, Choksi was arrested in April this year. His subsequent requests for bail have been denied by various courts in that country. The CBI has also engaged a European law firm specialising in extradition law to help in the case. A team of CBI officials will also be present to provide any necessary inputs, documentation, or perspectives. The agency has given a plethora of documents -- chargesheets, FIRs and evidence summaries against him -- to Belgian authorities showing that the charges he attracts in India are also punishable in that European country, a case of dual criminality that makes it a fit case for extradition under the treaty. Choksi is facing cases under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections related to criminal conspiracy, cheating, and falsification of accounts, as well as provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which constitute crimes in Belgium as well.",

The massive anti-government demonstrations across Nepal that forced Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli to resign on Tuesday led to a serious law and order situation across districts, prompting the Nepal Army on Wednesday to impose nationwide restrictive orders followed by a curfew. Inmates took advantage of the protests and tried to escape from jails, resulting in clashes across several prison facilities since Tuesday. \"Five juvenile inmates died in a clash with security personnel at the Naubasta Correctional Home in Naubasta Regional Jail located in Baijnath Rural Municipality-3 of Banke on Tuesday night,\" The Rising Nepal newspaper said. The five juvenile inmates were killed and four were seriously injured when police opened fire during a clash that broke out when inmates tried to take over the weapons of security personnel of the correctional home, the newspaper said, quoting the Naubasta Juvenile Correctional Home office. According to authorities, 149 of the 585 inmates from the prison and 76 of the 176 detainees from the juvenile home escaped during the incident. MyRepublica newspaper reported that around 7,000 inmates across the country have escaped from various prisons. Citing Home Ministry sources, the paper said that the escapes were reported from multiple facilities, including Dillibazar Jail (1,100), Chitwan (700), Nakkhu (1,200), Jhumpka in Sunsari (1,575), Kanchanpur (450), Kailali (612), Jaleshwar (576), Kaski (773), Dang (124), Jumla (36), Solukhumbu (86), Gaur (260), and Bajhang (65). \"The prisoners threatened security personnel while breaking out.

Preparations for the exercise were discussed during a meeting of the Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) from all states and Union Territories on Wednesday, where the proposal received a green light. The poll panel recently carried out a similarvoter roll revision in Biharahead of the state assembly elections. That process will now be expanded to cover all states and Union Territories. According to sources, the announcement for the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) could come even before the Bihar elections conclude. During the conference-cum-workshop, CEOs were asked how soon they could be ready for the revision. Most officials assured the Commission that basic groundwork would be completed by September, paving the way for an October launch. The day-long meeting, which included presentations lasting over three and a half hours, focused on the logistics and preparations for SIR. The Election Commission also directed state CEOs to prepare a list of documents that can be used for verifying voters during the revision, sources said. These would be based on locally accepted and easily available certificates, which vary across regions.",

The online discussion focused on possible candidates for the top post. While Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah was initially viewed as the favourite, participants said he did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him. \"Since he did not take our calls, the discussion shifted to other names. The most support has gone to Sushila Karki,\" a Gen Z representative was quoted as saying by Nepali media. Karki had earlier been approached with the proposal and reportedly asked for at least 1,000 written signatures as a show of support. According to sources, she has now secured over 2,500 signatures, exceeding the demand. Although Karki emerged as the leading contender, several other prominent names were discussed in the virtual meeting. Participants mentioned Kulman Ghising, the chief of Nepal Electricity Authority, along with youth leader Sagar Dhakal and Dharan Mayor Harka Sampang. A YouTuber, Random Nepali, also drew considerable backing.",

Reducing UAE to 51/5 inside the first 10 overs is a statement start. The only small concern for skipper Suryakumar could be managing his bowling resources. With Bumrah already through three overs in the powerplay and the spin trio of Kuldeep, Axar, and Varun each bowling two apiece, rotation will be key. Expect to see more of Hardik Pandya in the middle overs, and perhaps even Shivam Dube chipping in. An initial appeal from Varun Chakravathy given out by the umpire, but upon a review from UAE, it shows that the ball took a deflection from Dhruv Parashar's bat before hitting his stumps. Parashar looked confident from the very start, and UAE can breathe a little easy. WHAT A START FOR KULDEEP YADAV!!Sends 3 UAE batters packing, with Harshit Kaushik being his latest victim. Massive turn on the ball, which takes a nick of Kaushik bat and travels straight into the stumps.",

        "description": "In what is being called the biggest ever acquisition for a book, Legendary has bought the movie rights to SenLinYu's novel, ALCHEMISED, for a whopping 3 million USD. The seven figure purchase comes as an undeniable offer to the writer of the book and is meant to deter any competitors from trying their hand to grab the win. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, SenLinYu spoke about the acquisition, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honored by Legendary‚Äôs incredible enthusiasm for the project and can‚Äôt wait to see the world of Paladia come to life.‚Äù SenLinYu's novel presents romance between Harry Potter‚Äôs beloved characters The original fan-fic, ALCHEMISED, followed a forbidden love story between Gryffindor‚Äôs Hermione Granger ( ) and Slytherin‚Äôs Draco Malfoy ( ), however it is not known just how much of the JK Rowling characters would be continued or carried forward in the film adaptation. It is unlikely that many similarities between the two fictional worlds will continue owing to the copyright issues at hand. ALCHEMISED is based in the Dramonie side of the fan fiction world which follows the aces from the two opposing houses at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It runs over their unlikely love arc, and was first shared on the ‚Äòfan-created, fan-run, nonprofit, noncommercial archive‚Äô AO3 (Archive Of Our Own). The deal made for ALCHEMISED is believed to be the biggest ever for a new book's movie rights, not counting the inflation rates. It will probably set precedent for its successors as more releases and novel-to-movie adaptations become the norm. SenLinYu‚Äôs other popular AO3 works include a Harry Potter X Handmaiden‚Äôs Tale fan fic called Manacled with over 10 million views and another Star Wars work which followed Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and Rey. They will join many popular fan fictions being adapted into films including Fifty Shades of Grey, After series, and more, which have garnered millions of views across the globe.

The unborn child‚Äôs upright position in the womb, coupled with a 10-day delay and the child‚Äôs pooping inside the womb, made the child‚Äôs heartbeat reach 90 beats per minute. But the family refused.Nahi madam, aaj grahan hai toh humein bilkul operation nahi karana. Aap aaj ke din rakhiye aur kal delivery karaiye. (No, ma‚Äôam, we don‚Äôt want the delivery done today. Keep her underobservationtoday and deliver the child tomorrow, as today is an eclipse),‚Äù the doctor can be heard saying in the video..",

Scroll through Instagram, and it‚Äôs the same story ‚Äì endless reels of protein pancakes, protein coffees, protein bowls. Somehow, a nutrient that once sat quietly in the food pyramid has turned into a lifestyle statement. The numbers back it up, too. The global protein supplements market is valued at over $25 billion and continues to grow by nearly eight per cent every year, according toFortune. In India, where traditional diets are often carb-heavy, surveys by the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), under the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), show that seven out of 10 Indians are not meeting theirdaily protein needs. And yet, in urban pockets, protein has become the holy grail of health, marketed as the fix for everything from weight loss to better skin..",

Ahead of the high-voltage clash between India and Pakistan on September 14, India's T20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav, emphasised that aggression is essential in cricket and believes that without aggression, it's challenging to succeed in the sport. India will kick off their campaign against the UAE on Wednesday in Dubai, whereas Pakistan will clash with Oman at the same venue on Friday. \"Aggression is always there on the field, and without aggression, I don't think you can play this sport, and I am sure I am very excited to take the field,\" Suryakumar Yadav told the media. (LIVE Updates: India vs UAE, Asia Cup 2025 | Follow here) Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha responded to Suryakumar Yadav's comments, emphasising that every player is distinct with their own approach to the game. \"You don't need to say anything to any player because everyone is individually very different. If someone wants to be aggressive on the field, they are more than welcome to do that,\" Agha told the media. Even after the press conference ended, the duo was in the limelight. Salman went off the stage even as other captains were shaking hands. That led to social media chatter that Suryakumar and Salman ignored each other.",

The batter showed his trademark grace with cover drives that looked quite impressive. However, he was completely beaten by a brilliant delivery from one of the local net bowlers as he sneaked past his defences and uprooted his off stump.

Later, another video emerged which showed that the Pakistan skipper also shook the captains' hands before walking out from the exit door.

But unlike those larger iPhones, this one also offers access to the Pro processor range of Apple silicon. WhileApplethinks the phone will cater to those who needa thin and light iPhone with Pro features, the device puts it in a strange position, especially in price-conscious markets like India. Consumers will ask if this is a larger iPhone or a cheaper iPhone Pro. But when compared to basic iPhones, this has just one camera, though the price is more than the regular iPhone. Then this will be catering to those who want a more powerful and slim device, but are not really too bothered by its camera capabilities..",

Battery manufacturers have long known this, but silicon‚Äôs delicate nature has kept them from incorporating large amounts. Silicon tends to swell when storing lithium ions, and without some structure to support it, it will crumble quickly with successive charge cycles.

Companies that operate in the U.K. are obligated to notify the Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office within three days of discovering a data breach. It‚Äôs not immediately clear if the data relates to the company, its employees or customers. Jaguar Land Rover disclosed the cyberattack on September 2, saying the incident forced the company to shut down its systems, which ‚Äúseverely disrupted‚Äù its production line and sales operations. The incident is also affecting the company‚Äôs supply chains, including vehicle repairs. The carmaker is one of the largest employers in the U.K., with more than 33,000 staff. Perone newspaper report, U.K. government officials are said to be concerned about the economic fallout of the breach, and a recovery is expected to take weeks, not days..",

        "description": "For decades, engineers designing space structures have been constrained by the rocket fairing: only hardware that can be folded up to fit inside can go to orbit. This makes in-space assembly time intensive and expensive. The International Space Station, the largest single object humanity has built in space, was assembled over dozens of launches and cost over $100 billion. And, of course, there is no way to modify or alter the structure once it has been assembled. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre designing a space mission and trying to get a capability to space, you‚Äôre constrained by two things,‚Äù co-founder and President Joe Landon said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúOne, you have to build something that can either fit or fold into a rocket, and you also have to constrain yourself by what satellite bus you‚Äôre going to go on. We saw that increasingly, missions need more scale and more size ‚Ä¶ larger antennas, higher power, and with higher power, the need for larger radiators.‚Äù Instead of astronauts and robotic arms, Rendezvous is betting on autonomous swarm assembly and electromagnetism. The company is commercializing a technology called ‚Äútesserae,‚Äù flat-packed modular tiles that can launch in dense stacks and magnetically latch to form structures on obit. With a software command, the tiles are designed to unlatch and rearrange themselves when the mission changes. ‚ÄúThey find each other, they communicate‚Ä¶ they arrange themselves, come together using magnetic docking and then latch together,‚Äù Landon said.",

The rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. Granted, this was not slam-dunk evidence of past life on Mars, and the results were preliminary, awaiting peer review. But it was an intriguing possibility nonetheless. Now further analysis and peer review are complete, and there is a new paper, published in the journal Nature, reporting on the findings. It's still not definitive proof that there was water-based life on Mars billions of years ago, but the results are consistent with a biosignature. It's just that other non-biological processes would also be consistent with the data, so definitive proof might require analysis of the Martian samples back on Earth. You can watch NASA's livestream briefinghere. \"We have improved our understanding of the geological context of the discovery since [last year], and in the paper, we explore abiotic and biological pathways to the formation of the features that we observe,\" co-author Joel Hurowitz, an astrobiologist at Stony Brook University in New York, told Ars. \"My hope is that this discovery motivates a whole bunch of new research in laboratory and analog field settings on Earth to try to understand what conditions might give rise to the textures and mineral assemblages we've observed.",

        "description": "Flanked by Silicon Valley‚Äôs most powerful executives in the White House last week, Melania Trump hailed artificial intelligence as potentially ‚Äúthe greatest engine of progress in the history of the United States of America.‚Äù Less than a mile from the first lady, in a hotel ballroom packed with MAGA faithful, top Republican Josh Hawley had a different message. AI ‚Äúthreatens the common man‚Äôs liberty‚Äù and could even undermine the Republic itself, the senior US senator from Missouri said. ‚ÄúThe problem with the AI revolution as it‚Äôs currently going is that it only entrenches the power of the people who are already the most powerful people in the world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe goal is to replace... the farmer, the assembly line man, the construction worker.‚Äù Hawley is a frequent critic of Big Tech. But his comments are endorsed by a growing chorus on America‚Äôs right‚Äîeven as President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration scraps regulatory barriers and accelerates AI‚Äôs adoption across the land. It presages an unexpected clash at the heart of the MAGA world. Evangelical pastors, political strategists, and academics gathered at the recent National Conservatism Conference‚Äîthe MAGA movement‚Äôs ideological nerve center‚Äîwere full of contempt for the technology. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of people who are basically worried about... what actually is going to happen to unemployment and families and the culture and education with advanced AI, even if it doesn‚Äôt make it to artificial superintelligence,‚Äù said Geoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist who spoke on a panel at the conference.",

        "description": "Leading Internet companies and publishers‚Äîincluding Reddit, Yahoo, Quora, Medium, The Daily Beast, Fastly, and more‚Äîthink there may finally be a solution to endAI crawlers hammering websitesto scrape content without permission or compensation. Announced Wednesday morning, the \"Really Simply Licensing\" (RSL) standard evolves robots.txt instructions by adding an automated licensing layer that's designed to block bots that don't fairly compensate creators for content. Free for any publisher to use starting today, the RSL standard is an open, decentralized protocol that makes clear to AI crawlers and agents the terms for licensing, usage, and compensation of any content used to train AI, a press release noted. The standard was created by theRSL Collective, which was founded by Doug Leeds, former CEO of Ask.com, and Eckart Walther, a former Yahoo vice president of products and co-creator of the RSS standard, which made it easy to syndicate content across the web. Based on the \"Really Simply Syndication\" (RSS) standard, RSL terms can be applied to protect any digital content, including webpages, books, videos, and datasets. The new standard supports \"a range of licensing, usage, and royalty models, including free, attribution, subscription, pay-per-crawl (publishers get compensated every time an AI application crawls their content), and pay-per-inference (publishers get compensated every time an AI application uses their content to generate a response),\" the press release said. Leeds told Ars that the idea to use the RSS \"playbook\" to roll out the RSL standard arose after he invited Walther to speak to University of California, Berkeley students at the end of last year. That's when the longtime friends with search backgrounds began pondering how AI had changed the search industry, as publishers today are forced to compete with AI outputs referencing their own contentas search traffic nosedives. Eckart had watched the RSS standard quickly become adopted by millions of site...",

        "description": "Apple's most famous chips are the A- and M-series processors that power its iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but this year, its effort to build its own wireless chips is starting to bear fruit. Earlier this spring, the iPhone 16e included Apple's C1 modem, furthering Apple's ambitions to shed its dependence on Qualcomm, and today's iPhone Air brought a faster Apple C1X variant, plus something new: the Apple N1, a chip that provides Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support for all of today's new iPhones. Apple didn't dive deep into the capabilities of the N1, or why it had switched from using third-party suppliers (historically, Apple has mostly leaned on Broadcom for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). However, the company's press releases say that it should make Continuity features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop more reliable‚Äîthese features use Bluetooth for initial communication and then Wi-Fi to establish a high-speed local link between two devices. Other features that use a similar combination of wireless technologies, like using an iPad as an extended Mac display, should also benefit. These aren't Apple's first chips to integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth technology. The Apple Watches rely on W-series chips to provide their Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity; the Apple H1 and H2 chips also provide Bluetooth connectivity for many of Apple's wireless headphones. But this is the first time that Apple has switched to its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip in one of its iPhones, suggesting that the chips have matured enough to provide higher connectivity speeds for more demanding devices. Apple will likely expand the use of the N1 (and other N-series chips) beyond the iPhone soon enough. Macs and iPads are obvious candidates, but the presence of Thread support also suggests that we'll see it in new smart home devices like the Apple TV or HomePod..",

It shifted to \"basically the same phone in two sizes\" a decade or so ago, and then to a version of \"one lineup of regular phones and one lineup of Pro phones\" in 2017 when the iPhone 8 was introduced next to the iPhone X. But thanks to Apple's newly introduced iPhone Air, the iPhone 17 lineup gives new phone buyers more choices and trade-offs than they've ever had before. Apple's phones are now available in a spectrum of sizes, weights, speeds, costs, and camera configurations. And while options are great to have, it also means you need to know more about which one to pick. We've gone hands-on with all four of Apple's new phones, and while more extensive tire-kicking will be required, we can at least try to nail down exactly what kind of person each of these phones is for. There's no more iPhone mini, and there's no more iPhone Plus. Now we have an iPhone Air, and it is very much its own thing. The phone is just over two-thirds the thickness of the iPhone 17, not counting what Apple now calls a \"camera plateau\" that stretches across the top of the device. It's 0.22 inches thick and weighs 5.82 ounces, compared to 0.31 inches thick and 6.24 ounces for the iPhone 17.",

The positive results come asAmericans face a confusing, state-by-state patchwork of access to the shotsunder health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an ardent anti-vaccine activist who has unilaterally restricted access. Prior to the second Trump administration, all Americans ages 6 months and older had access to the vaccines. But under Kennedy, the Food and Drug Administration limited COVID-19 vaccine approvals to people 65 and older, and people under 64 years only if they have an underlying medical condition. In Pfizer and BioNTech's latest trial, the companies limited enrollment to these groups. The phase 3 trial included 100 people total, 50 people age 65 or older and 50 people age 18 to 64 with an underlying condition.Those conditionsincluded asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, HIV, mental health conditions, Parkinson's disease, obesity, or smoking. All participants had gotten last season's COVID shot at least six months prior to the trial and had not gotten any other COVID-19 vaccines or a COVID-19 infection since then. This year's Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine targets the SARS-CoV-2 strain LP.8.1, a variant in the JN.1 family. In both age groups in the trial, the LP.8.1 vaccines boosted LP.8.1-neutralizing antibody levels by at least fourfold, on average.",

This has altered global student mobility. According to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), nearly 80% of Indian student visa applications were rejected in 2025. Indian students comprise around 40% of Canada's international students. Four out of five Indian applicants received refusals in the second quarter of 2025, education outletThe PIE Newsreported, citing figures from BorderPass. As per data from the Canadian government, 1.88 lakh Indian students were admitted in 2024. This number was more than double two years ago. While Ottawa hasn't shared a country-wise breakdown, The PIE News reported that the high rejection rate is affecting students across Asia, Africa and beyond, showing how Canada is changing its approach to international education. For decades, North America was the default choice for many students drawn by safety, opportunity and world-class institutions. But recent figures point to a major shift.",

Lecornu is set to take office on Wednesday just asFrance saw widespread protestsled by a left-wing grassroots movement known as \"Block Everything\" (Bloquons tout). Analysts say Lecornu faces a baptism of fire, faced with a twin challenge - managing a politically fractured parliament and a highly mobilised public against the government's spending cuts and austerity measures. In Rennes, demonstrators set a bus on fire and caused damage to a power line in the southwest. Around200 arrests have taken place so far, authorities said. The \"Block Everything\" collective is a citizen-led movement calling for boycott, civil disobedience, and solidarity in response to government policies. Unlike traditional strikes led by unions or political parties, the movement is independent, organised primarily through social media platforms such as X, TikTok, Telegram, and Facebook. Supporters are using hashtags like #10septembre2025 and #10septembre to spread their message, encouraging actions such as: Although the protests did not fully achieve their self-declared goal of \"blocking everything,\" they caused widespread disruption and showed growing public anger. The immediate trigger is Francois Bayrou's 2026 budget, which proposes: Even before September 10, the protests caused significant disruption across the country. Demonstrators attempted to block highways in Bordeaux, while a cable fire in Toulouse affected rail traffic.",

If someone does not, then their being Indian itself is doubtful,\" Mr Adityanath said. He said Mahant Digvijaynath had resolved to remove the symbols of slavery and dreamt of building a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya by removing the disputed structure there. \"Today, that dream of both Mahant Digvijaynath and Mahant Avaidyanath has been fulfilled,\" he said. Quoting a Sanskrit line, Mr Adityanath said every individual has potential and only needs the right guidance. He praised the two late mahants for guiding society and the nation through their commitment and sacrifice, dedicating their lives to the country and religion. Mr Adityanath also said that a saint regards society as his family and the nation as his clan, with his only identity being Sanatan Dharma. \"When a true saint takes a vow, its results are bound to be seen,\" he said, adding that \"the Ram temple stands as a testimony to the mahants' determination and struggle.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

        "description": "The extradition proceeding against diamantaire Mehul Choksi, wanted in the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case, is likely to commence in a Belgian court next Monday, officials said. The court hearings will be led by Belgian federal prosecutors, with support from the CBI and India's Ministry of External Affairs. Choksi is understood to have held residency in Belgium since 2023, having relocated to the European country from Antigua and Barbuda for medical treatment, officials said, adding that his wife is a Belgian national. The CBI had received information of his presence in Belgium in January 2024, following which an extradition request was dispatched to the European country with which India had signed a treaty in 2020, making it the first case under the arrangement, they said. Based on India's request, Choksi was arrested in April this year. His subsequent requests for bail have been denied by various courts in that country. The CBI has also engaged a European law firm specialising in extradition law to help in the case. A team of CBI officials will also be present to provide any necessary inputs, documentation, or perspectives. The agency has given a plethora of documents -- chargesheets, FIRs and evidence summaries against him -- to Belgian authorities showing that the charges he attracts in India are also punishable in that European country, a case of dual criminality that makes it a fit case for extradition under the treaty. Choksi is facing cases under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections related to criminal conspiracy, cheating, and falsification of accounts, as well as provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which constitute crimes in Belgium as well.",

The massive anti-government demonstrations across Nepal that forced Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli to resign on Tuesday led to a serious law and order situation across districts, prompting the Nepal Army on Wednesday to impose nationwide restrictive orders followed by a curfew. Inmates took advantage of the protests and tried to escape from jails, resulting in clashes across several prison facilities since Tuesday. \"Five juvenile inmates died in a clash with security personnel at the Naubasta Correctional Home in Naubasta Regional Jail located in Baijnath Rural Municipality-3 of Banke on Tuesday night,\" The Rising Nepal newspaper said. The five juvenile inmates were killed and four were seriously injured when police opened fire during a clash that broke out when inmates tried to take over the weapons of security personnel of the correctional home, the newspaper said, quoting the Naubasta Juvenile Correctional Home office. According to authorities, 149 of the 585 inmates from the prison and 76 of the 176 detainees from the juvenile home escaped during the incident. MyRepublica newspaper reported that around 7,000 inmates across the country have escaped from various prisons. Citing Home Ministry sources, the paper said that the escapes were reported from multiple facilities, including Dillibazar Jail (1,100), Chitwan (700), Nakkhu (1,200), Jhumpka in Sunsari (1,575), Kanchanpur (450), Kailali (612), Jaleshwar (576), Kaski (773), Dang (124), Jumla (36), Solukhumbu (86), Gaur (260), and Bajhang (65). \"The prisoners threatened security personnel while breaking out.

Reducing UAE to 51/5 inside the first 10 overs is a statement start. The only small concern for skipper Suryakumar could be managing his bowling resources. With Bumrah already through three overs in the powerplay and the spin trio of Kuldeep, Axar, and Varun each bowling two apiece, rotation will be key. Expect to see more of Hardik Pandya in the middle overs, and perhaps even Shivam Dube chipping in. An initial appeal from Varun Chakravathy given out by the umpire, but upon a review from UAE, it shows that the ball took a deflection from Dhruv Parashar's bat before hitting his stumps. Parashar looked confident from the very start, and UAE can breathe a little easy. WHAT A START FOR KULDEEP YADAV!!Sends 3 UAE batters packing, with Harshit Kaushik being his latest victim. Massive turn on the ball, which takes a nick of Kaushik bat and travels straight into the stumps.",

The seven figure purchase comes as an undeniable offer to the writer of the book and is meant to deter any competitors from trying their hand to grab the win. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, SenLinYu spoke about the acquisition, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honored by Legendary‚Äôs incredible enthusiasm for the project and can‚Äôt wait to see the world of Paladia come to life.‚Äù SenLinYu's novel presents romance between Harry Potter‚Äôs beloved characters The original fan-fic, ALCHEMISED, followed a forbidden love story between Gryffindor‚Äôs Hermione Granger ( ) and Slytherin‚Äôs Draco Malfoy ( ), however it is not known just how much of the JK Rowling characters would be continued or carried forward in the film adaptation. It is unlikely that many similarities between the two fictional worlds will continue owing to the copyright issues at hand. ALCHEMISED is based in the Dramonie side of the fan fiction world which follows the aces from the two opposing houses at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It runs over their unlikely love arc, and was first shared on the ‚Äòfan-created, fan-run, nonprofit, noncommercial archive‚Äô AO3 (Archive Of Our Own). The deal made for ALCHEMISED is believed to be the biggest ever for a new book's movie rights, not counting the inflation rates. It will probably set precedent for its successors as more releases and novel-to-movie adaptations become the norm. SenLinYu‚Äôs other popular AO3 works include a Harry Potter X Handmaiden‚Äôs Tale fan fic called Manacled with over 10 million views and another Star Wars work which followed Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and Rey.

Scroll through Instagram, and it‚Äôs the same story ‚Äì endless reels of protein pancakes, protein coffees, protein bowls. Somehow, a nutrient that once sat quietly in the food pyramid has turned into a lifestyle statement. The numbers back it up, too. The global protein supplements market is valued at over $25 billion and continues to grow by nearly eight per cent every year, according toFortune. In India, where traditional diets are often carb-heavy, surveys by the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), under the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), show that seven out of 10 Indians are not meeting theirdaily protein needs. And yet, in urban pockets, protein has become the holy grail of health, marketed as the fix for everything from weight loss to better skin..",
