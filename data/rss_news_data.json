An article in the party's mouthpiece, Murasoli, claimed that the party and its government's three-pronged outreach - through the DMK organisation, state government schemes, and Chief Minister MK Stalin's direct engagements - will ensure a second term. The article underlined the progress made through a coordinated effort led by the party, government, and Stalin himself - reaching out to voters, strengthening grassroots connections, and publicising government welfare schemes. Under its flagship campaign \"Tamil Nadu in One Alliance\", the DMK aims to enrol 30% of the state's voters as DMK members. Party functionaries have been meeting households across the state, highlighting government welfare schemes - a drive the party believes is already resonating with the public.",
