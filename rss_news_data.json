The traditional count is called \"swan upping\", but in recent years it has been more like swan downing, with numbers plunging due to avian flu and human cruelty, including reports of swans being attacked by catapults and air guns. But the new figures released by the King's swan marker, David Barber, show a more optimistic picture, after a 45% fall over the past two years.",
