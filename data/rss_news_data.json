The search-focused AI startup is rapidly adding millions of users in the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market, positioning itself for mass-market scale. This week, Perplexitypartnered with Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator after Reliance Jio, to offer a free 12-month Perplexity Pro subscription — normally worth $200 — to all 360 million Airtel subscribers. Airtel confirmed to TechCrunch that the deal is exclusive, meaning no other telco in the country can offer Perplexity’s services, including free access, to their subscribers.",

The House of Representatives voted to pass the GENIUS Act on Thursday, approving the same bill that the Senate passed last month. The law provides a federal framework for stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that's considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, as each token is backed by the US dollar or other supposedly low-risk assets. The GENIUS Act is expected to spur more widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, since stablecoins are often used to move funds between different tokens.",

The last time these sides met in an ODI in England, in 2022, Deepti scored an unbeaten fifty to rescue her side from an early stumble then ran out Charlie Dean while backing up on the last ball to seal a 3-0 ODI series sweep at Lord's. On Wednesday night, Deepti's unbeaten 62 off 64 balls allowed India to chase down 259 to win by four wickets with 10 balls to spare.

The 31-year-old did not feature in any matches during the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy, playing second fiddle to captain and first-choice wicketkeeper Akshay Wadkar. He remained part of Vidarbha's white-ball squads, led by Karun Nair. The transfer to Baroda has reportedly been in the works for some time, with Jitesh's close ties to Baroda captain Krunal Pandya, his fellow Royal Challengers Bengaluru teammate during their maiden IPL title win earlier this year, believed to have helped facilitate the move. The shift could give Jitesh a renewed opportunity to cement his place as a regular in first-class cricket.",

Prada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearinga toe-braided sandal that looked like the Kolhapuri chappal, a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. As the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a \"dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans\".",

The search-focused AI startup is rapidly adding millions of users in the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market, positioning itself for mass-market scale. This week, Perplexitypartnered with Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator after Reliance Jio, to offer a free 12-month Perplexity Pro subscription — normally worth $200 — to all 360 million Airtel subscribers. Airtel confirmed to TechCrunch that the deal is exclusive, meaning no other telco in the country can offer Perplexity’s services, including free access, to their subscribers.",

The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash.

The last time these sides met in an ODI in England, in 2022, Deepti scored an unbeaten fifty to rescue her side from an early stumble then ran out Charlie Dean while backing up on the last ball to seal a 3-0 ODI series sweep at Lord's. On Wednesday night, Deepti's unbeaten 62 off 64 balls allowed India to chase down 259 to win by four wickets with 10 balls to spare.

The 31-year-old did not feature in any matches during the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy, playing second fiddle to captain and first-choice wicketkeeper Akshay Wadkar. He remained part of Vidarbha's white-ball squads, led by Karun Nair. The transfer to Baroda has reportedly been in the works for some time, with Jitesh's close ties to Baroda captain Krunal Pandya, his fellow Royal Challengers Bengaluru teammate during their maiden IPL title win earlier this year, believed to have helped facilitate the move. The shift could give Jitesh a renewed opportunity to cement his place as a regular in first-class cricket.",

Ben Stokes was in the middle of bowling himself into the ground, a 10-over spell leading England to tea after an 9.2-over spell had made them favourites in the morning. Neither man deserves to come off second best in this battle, which also included a bizarre moment when Stokes, in addition to figuring out where to set his fields and whether his body could take the workload he was putting himself through, had to sign off on Jadeja's bathroom schedule.

        "description": "Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer brought quality, intensity and fire to proceedings England came to Lord's looking for six wickets. They bagged four of them before lunch in an inspired morning's play where their captain Ben Stokes and their returning talismanic fast bowler Jofra Archer brought quality, intensity and fire to proceedings. India were in the mire early when Rishabh Pant, hampered by the injured finger on his left hand, fell on the third over of the day. Three overs later, Stokes got one to nip down the slope at the Nursery end to trap KL Rahul lbw. Stokes bowled a nine-over spell this morning, constantly threatening everyone who made the mistake of standing 22 yards away.",

Brydon Carse removed Karun Nair and Shubman Gill cheaply for impressive figures of 2 for 11 from four overs and Ben Stokes bowled nightwatcher Akash Deep with the last ball of the day as three wickets fell in the last half-hour of play. Stokes' magic is spread thin by responsibility, and yet it endures Brook's shot selection under scrutiny as counterattack goes awry Washington's 4 for 22 included the key names of Joe Root, Jamie Smith and Stokes before he claimed t...",

Washington claimed the big wicket of Joe Root for 40, rattling leg stump with one that slid under the bat as Root attempted to sweep, breaking his fifth-wicket stand with Ben Stokes at 67 in the process. Four overs later, Washington bowled Jamie Smith for just 8 with an excellent quicker ball that didn't turn but skidded past the outside edge and onto off stump. At that point England were 164 for 6 and they were subsequently becalmed as Stokes, unbeaten at the interval on 27, and Chris Woakes looked to avoid further damage.

Mohammed Siraj took two wickets from a miserly seven-over spell, starting with Ben Duckett, who pulled to Jasprit Bumrah at mid-on and faced an impassioned send-off from the bowler that maintained the tension of the previous evening. Siraj struck again when he pinned Ollie Pope lbw, although it took an India review to confirm his dismissal. Bumrah bowled beautifully without reward, exploiting uneven bounce and keeping Zak Crawley on edge after a face-off the previous evening between Crawley and Shubman Gill, who was incensed by England's time-wasting in what became the solitary over of the innings on day three.
