In the space of nine overs, Zimbabwe lost four wickets for 19 runs© AFP/Getty Images Mushfiqur Rahman and his team-mates celebrate Tatenda Taibu's wicket. In the space of nine overs, Zimbabwe lost four wickets for 19 runs© AFP/Getty Images From June 1999 to February 2004, Bangladesh had racked up some unwanted records - most consecutive defeats in international cricket, which included most consecutive Test defeats, the longest winless streak in that format, and the most consecutive ODI defeats. Now under a new captain, Bangladesh were hoping for better days. Habibul Bashar, Bangladesh captain:The Zimbabwe team was far ahead of us in those days, that too in their conditions. We had already lost the Test series. Imade a pair in my first Test as captain. While we waited for the rain to stop in Bulawayo [where the first two ODIs had to be abandoned], coachDav Whatmorewas trying to instil the mentality of trying to win rather than thinking about playing well and losing - he would tell us that there was no glory in that. Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh batsman:One day on the tour, I was telling Shuvrobhai[journalist Utpal Shuvro] that the Bangladesh public treats us as heroes even though we don't win any matches. We have such a wonderful following despite our results.",

        "description": "The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are official, withApplehaving unveiled both devices at its hardware-heavy'Awe Dropping' launch event. The two new phones are undoubtedly the premium models in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup (which also features the standardiPhone 17and the wafer-thiniPhone Air), and are set to top our rankings of thebest iPhones.But what, specifically, makes them so special? In this guide, we've rounded up some of the key upgrades introduced with the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max – from their new chipsets and camera hardware to their refreshingly different designs. The most immediately obvious upgrade – or at least change – for Apple's Pro-level iPhones is their new designs. Both the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max sport a large camera block that runs horizontally across their respective rear panels, which Apple is calling a \"full-width camera plateau.\" This is a marked change from Apple's square-shaped, corner-positioned camera block, which has been a feature of every Pro-level iPhone since theiPhone 11 Pro(though it's worth noting that the cameras themselves are still arranged in the same triangular orientation). It's clear, then, that the iPhone 17 Pro needed a facelift, but this new, larger camera block also has a practical purpose: it houses bigger sensors and more advanced imaging technology (more on this later). Additionally, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max have a brushed aluminum unibody design, whereas theiPhone 16 ProandiPhone 15 Prouse a titanium frame. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Apple has made this change to deliver \"the best-ever thermal performance in an iPhone,\" and the company's Ceramic Shield technology now protects both the front and back sides of its flagship iPhone. Both the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max feature a 48MP telephoto camera with 8x optical zoom. Yes, you read that right: an 8x optical zoom.",

The initiative combines Aave’s onchain lending markets with Bitget Wallet’s proprietary yield subsidies, enabling users worldwide to earn dollar-denominated income with instant access to funds. The product channels user-supplied USDC into Aave’s overcollateralized lending pools on the Base network, where interest from borrowers is supplemented by Bitget Wallet to guarantee a minimum return of 10% APY on deposits up to US$10,000. Participation starts from as little as US$1, with earnings accruing in real time and withdrawals processed in seconds. This ensures deposits remain liquid for transfers, trading, or payments — a stark contrast to traditional banking products, which can take days to release funds and offer rates below 2% annually.

You’ll also get round-trip coach airfare and ground transportation to and from Disney World and Riviera Resort.

        "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Serviceis a fully managed service to support search, log analytics, and generative AI Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) workloads in the AWS Cloud. It simplifies the deployment, security, and scaling of OpenSearch clusters. As organizations scale their log analytics workloads by continuously collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data, they often struggle to maintain quick access to historical information while managing costs effectively. OpenSearch Service addresses these challenges through its tiered storage options: hot, UltraWarm, and cold storage. These storage tiers are great options to help optimize costs and offer a balance between performance and affordability, so organizations can manage their data more efficiently. Organizations canchoose between these different storage tiersby keeping data in expensive hot storage for quick access or moving it to cheaper cold storage with limited accessibility. This trade-off becomes particularly challenging when organizations need to analyze both recent and historical data for compliance, trend analysis, or business intelligence. In this post, we explore how to use index rollups in Amazon OpenSearch Service to address this challenge. This feature helps organizations efficiently manage their historical data by automatically summarizing and compressing older data while maintaining its analytical value, significantly reducing storage costs in any storage tier without sacrificing the ability to query historical information effectively. Index rollups provide a mechanism to aggregate historical data into summarized indexes at specified time intervals.",

In an aerial view, natural gas is flared off during an oil-drilling operation in the Permian Basin oil field on March 12, 2022 in Stanton, Texas. \"It's time to stop paying polluters to wreck our planet,\" said one environmental advocate. Research and advocacy organizationOil Change Internationalon Tuesdayreleaseda new report documenting the massive subsidies that fossil fuel companies receive from the US government every year. Thereport, titled \"Paying for Climate Chaos,\" found that the government will hand out $34.8 billion to big oil and gas companies this year, and that these companies are set to get almost an additional $4 billion in subsidies thanks to the so-called \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" passed by congressional Republicans and signed into law by US PresidentDonald Trumpearlier this year. Among the added benefits fossil fuel companies receive from the GOP's budget law are $1.2 billion in the form of reduced royalty rates for extracting oil and gas on public lands; $720 million from a delay in the implementation of a per-ton methane emissions fee; and $359 million from the expansion of a corporate tax exemption to include categories such as carbon capture and hydrogen storage. The report found that total subsidies to fossil fuel companies had grown significantly since Oil Change International first began studying the issue back in 2017 when subsidies totaled a comparatively modest $20 billion. What's more, it noted that the price tag for these subsidies only looks set to increase over the next decade. \"Many subsidies identified are projected to soar over the next decade and beyond,\" Oil Change Internationalwrites. \"If federal leaders fail to act, fossil fuel production subsidies could skyrocket to hundreds of billions of dollars per year.",

        "description": "HONG KONG (AP) — NBA greatLeBron Jameswrote a rare op-ed in Chinese state media this week, pointing to basketball as an avenue for diplomacy amid tensions with the U.S. Writing in Monday’s edition of the People’s Daily newspaper, the 40-year-old Los Angeles Lakers star said “basketball is not only a sport, but also a bridge that connects us.” The piece was published as James was in China ahead of twoNBA pre-season games next month in Macaobetween the Phoenix Suns and the Brooklyn Nets. And it comes as leaders in China and the U.S. seek options to avert a potential trade showdown between the world’s two biggest economies. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on China, which has said it would respond with retaliatory levies of its own. Trump said last month that he woulddelay the tariffsfor 90 days as negotiators from both countries work on a potential deal, which could ultimately lead to a summit later this year or early next year between the U.S. leader and Chinese PresidentXi Jinping. As the standoff unfolds, James’ comments caught the attention of the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, which reported: “It is rare for the mouthpiece of China’s ruling Communist Party to run articles carrying the byline of foreign sports stars. It is more common for international sporting heroes to connect with fans in China via Chinese social media.” The NBA is working to rebuild its brand in greater China, where basketball has long been popular.",

        "description": "With job growth tanking and the economy wobbling, pressure is on for the Federal Reserve to start lowering interest rates, with markets now expecting a cut at each of the three remaining meetings this year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday that theeconomy added 911,000 fewer jobsthan previously reported for the year preceding March 2025. Downward revisions since the cutoff date in that report suggest that the reduction in payroll growth has been actually around 1.2 million for the past 16 months. That's a number sure to get the Federal Open Market Committee's attention when it meets next week and could add fire to President Donald Trump's repeated assertions that the central bank has been \"too late\" in making policy adjustments. \"Had Fed officials had that data available in real time, policy rates would be lower today,\" wrote Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst, referencing the BLS \"benchmark\" payrolls revisions. Hollenhorst said the data actually \"could justify\" a jumbo half percentage point cut when the FOMC releases its decision Sept. 17. However, he expects ChairJerome Powell\"will have an easier time building consensus around a [quarter-point] rate cut next week, with signals that rate cuts will continue at upcoming meetings, including potentially in October.\" Market expectations have shifted notably as trouble signs have built around employment. Traders now are not only pricing in a 100% chance that the Fed lowers by a quarter point next week, they also are allowing for a slight chance of a half-point reduction. They now firmly see cuts at each of the three remaining meetings, according to the CME Group'sFedWatchtool.",

The primary sector is defined as the economic sector that produces goods by exploiting natural resources like land, water, forests, mines, etc. Agriculture is one of the most important primary sectors. However, while agriculture’s share in employment has fallen slowly, its share in GDP has declined relatively faster. It underlinesthe slow nature of structural transformation of the Indian economy. As a result, agriculture is no longer the primary driving force of the economy. What remains hidden, though, is theroleof the non-agricultural primary sector in most discussions on the Indian economy..",

Speaking at the NDTV Profit GST Conclave, Sitharaman said that taxable items were viewed from the lens of daily consumption, aspirational items for the middle class, for farmers, and items which are important to the Indian economy at large. All 140 crore Indians will have something or the other where the tax reduction will come through, she assured. GST 2.0 was in the making for almost 1.5 years, Sitharaman said, adding that she was waiting for a worthy pack of reforms before presenting the overhaul. While thanking ministers from multiple parties and states who acceded to the reforms, she noted that the GST Council meeting was not at all acrimonious. The council is accustomed to discussion of this nature, she said, but clarified that the decision to bring down the rates saw no opposition from anyone. The difference was on the path of revenue falling, the finance minister said. On that, she said that Centre and states are together, with both seeing the impact. As such, efficiency will have to increase to offset the fall, she added..",

In the space of nine overs, Zimbabwe lost four wickets for 19 runs© AFP/Getty Images From June 1999 to February 2004, Bangladesh had racked up some unwanted records - most consecutive defeats in international cricket, which included most consecutive Test defeats, the longest winless streak in that format, and the most consecutive ODI defeats. Now under a new captain, Bangladesh were hoping for better days. Habibul Bashar, Bangladesh captain:The Zimbabwe team was far ahead of us in those days, that too in their conditions. We had already lost the Test series. Imade a pair in my first Test as captain. While we waited for the rain to stop in Bulawayo [where the first two ODIs had to be abandoned], coachDav Whatmorewas trying to instil the mentality of trying to win rather than thinking about playing well and losing - he would tell us that there was no glory in that. Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh batsman:One day on the tour, I was telling Shuvrobhai[journalist Utpal Shuvro] that the Bangladesh public treats us as heroes even though we don't win any matches.

The primary sector is defined as the economic sector that produces goods by exploiting natural resources like land, water, forests, mines, etc. Agriculture is one of the most important primary sectors. However, while agriculture’s share in employment has fallen slowly, its share in GDP has declined relatively faster. It underlinesthe slow nature of structural transformation of the Indian economy. As a result, agriculture is no longer the primary driving force of the economy. What remains hidden, though, is theroleof the non-agricultural primary sector in most discussions on the Indian economy..",

        "description": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that she is confident of GST rate cuts passing through to the end consumers, and has trust in the industry and traders. Speaking at the NDTV Profit GST Conclave, Sitharaman said that taxable items were viewed from the lens of daily consumption, aspirational items for the middle class, for farmers, and items which are important to the Indian economy at large. All 140 crore Indians will have something or the other where the tax reduction will come through, she assured. GST 2.0 was in the making for almost 1.5 years, Sitharaman said, adding that she was waiting for a worthy pack of reforms before presenting the overhaul. While thanking ministers from multiple parties and states who acceded to the reforms, she noted that the GST Council meeting was not at all acrimonious. The council is accustomed to discussion of this nature, she said, but clarified that the decision to bring down the rates saw no opposition from anyone. The difference was on the path of revenue falling, the finance minister said. On that, she said that Centre and states are together, with both seeing the impact. As such, efficiency will have to increase to offset the fall, she added..",
