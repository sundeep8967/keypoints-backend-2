        "description": "US President Donald Trump was heckled by protesters shouting “Free DC! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!” as he dined at a Washington restaurant on Tuesday evening, videos circulating online showed. The US President briefly approached the demonstrators inside Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak + Stone Crab, just blocks from the White House. He paused a few feet away, nodding and smiling before gesturing for them to be cleared out, saying: “come on, let’s go.” Secret Service agents then escorted the protesters, who waved Palestinian flags, out of the restaurant as other diners booed or chanted “U-S-A! U-S-A!”.",

Lecornu replaced Fracois Bayrou, who was ousted in a parliamentary vote on Monday over his plans to slash the country’s outsized budget deficit. Here are the key developments that took place in the country rocked by anti-government protests: After Lecornu assumed office, the hard-left said it would seek to overthrow him from power with an immediate no-confidence motion, while the far-right National Rally (RN) hinted at supporting him on thebudget, upon the condition that its demands are met. Notably, the RN is the country’s largest parliamentary party and assumes significance in any potential no-confidence motion. However, Lecornu is perceived as the closest member of Macron’s circle to the RN, considering that he had dined with party president Jordan Bardella last year..",

In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high.”.",

They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance — ideally in labs on Earth — before reaching any conclusions. Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth — an ambitious plan that’s on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options..",

But unlike those larger iPhones, this one also offers access to the Pro processor range of Apple silicon. WhileApplethinks the phone will cater to those who needa thin and light iPhone with Pro features, the device puts it in a strange position, especially in price-conscious markets like India. Consumers will ask if this is a larger iPhone or a cheaper iPhone Pro. But when compared to basic iPhones, this has just one camera, though the price is more than the regular iPhone. Then this will be catering to those who want a more powerful and slim device, but are not really too bothered by its camera capabilities..",

        "description": "Arm Holdings said on Tuesday it was launching its next-generation set of chip designs called Lumex that it has optimized for artificial intelligence to run on mobile devices such as smartphones and watches without accessing the internet. Called Lumex, the new generation of Arm mobile designs come in four types, ranging from less powerful but more energy efficient ones designed for watches and other smart wearable devices to a version designed to maximize the computing horsepower available. The peak performance design aims to run software that harnesses the power of large AI models without accessing cloud computing on devices such as high-end smartphones. “AI is becoming pretty fundamental to kind of what’s happening, whether it’s kind of real-time interactions or some killer use cases like AI translation,” said Chris Bergey, a senior vice president and general manager at Arm. “We’re just seeing (AI) become kind of this expectation.”.",

The feature initiallylaunchedas a pilot in 2023, available to a limited number of creators, including MrBeast, Mark Rober, and chef Jamie Oliver. Creators had to work with third-party dubbing services until YouTube introduced anAI-powered auto-dubbing toolthat leverages Google’s Gemini technology to replicate a creator’s tone and emotions. Since its launch, YouTube reports that several testers have seen success with this feature. On average, those who uploaded multi-language audio tracks saw over 25% of their watch time coming from views in the video’s non-primary language. Jamie Oliver’s channel, for instance, tripled in views after using multi-language audio tracks. Additionally, the company has been testing multi-language thumbnails with a select group of creators. Since June, creators have been able to customize thumbnails to display text in other languages, catering to their international audience.",

But the company’s also been pushing into the far less glamorous world of tugboats, and now has its first big order worth $160 million. The company announced Wednesday it has signed a contract of that value with Curtin Maritime, a tug and barge operator. The new hybrid-electric tugs are expected to hit the waters around the Los Angeles port in 2027. Curtin has ordered eight tugs — at around $20 million apiece — and Arc will build them in conjunction with Snow & Co. shipyard. Specifically, these are what’s known as ship-assist tugboats, which help nudge behemoth cargo ships into and out of major ports like Los Angeles. Arc CEO and co-founder Mitch Lee told TechCrunch these kinds of tugboats are “torque generating machines, which is really cool.” But the standard versions are powered by monster diesel engines that “just spew black carbon, [and] spew sulfur oxides” into the air, damaging the surrounding environment and risking the long-term health of the crews who work them. Lee said these kinds of tugs are some of the worst-polluting vehicles on the planet by linear foot. By largely replacing the diesel power plants with batteries and electric motors — more on the hybrid system in a moment — Arc can help tugboat operators cut down on that pollution.",

Trump's Commerce Department rewrote the rules of the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program, forcing states to change how they spend money earmarked for expanding broadband access. The overhaul led states to reduce spending on fiber networks and increase spending on satellite—although not to the extent sought by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who isdemanding more moneyfor his Starlink network. Since states are spending less on deployment, and the program still has the $42 billion allocated by Congress, what happens to the leftover amount after money is spent on deploying broadband networks? Amid speculation that the Trump administration wants to return that money to the US Treasury, Louisiana's Republican governor is worried that states won't be able to use the full $42 billion. It's possible that half or more of the $42 billion won't be used to expand broadband. \"As the first state to submit our Final Proposal ahead of the September 4th deadline, we respectfully request that you continue to hew closely to the statute by directing that remaining BEAD allocations be invested in state-led initiatives, subject to NTIA [National Telecommunications and Information Administration] review, that advance the following key national priorities,\" Landry wrote in aMonday letterto Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. TheUS lawthat created BEAD is clear that the money can be used for more than sending subsidies to Internet service providers. The \"key national priorities\" specifically cited in Landry's letter were Trump's \"AI Action Plan\" along with Trump's \"America First\" and \"Make America Great Again\" plans for investing in education, workforce training, and growing US industries.

It's no surprise then that, after a decade, some Spotify users who are especially eager to see Wrapped evolve are no longer willing to wait to see if Spotify will ever deliver the more creative streaming insights they crave. With the help of AI, these users expect that their data can be more quickly analyzed to potentially uncover overlooked or never-considered patterns that could offer even more insights into what their listening habits say about them. Imagine, for example, accessing a music recap that encapsulates a user's full listening history—not just their top songs and artists. With that unlocked, users could track emotional patterns, analyzing how their music tastes reflected their moods over time and perhaps helping them adjust their listening habits to better cope with stress or major life events. And for users particularly intrigued by their own data, there's even the potential to use AI to cross data streams from different platforms and perhaps understand even more about how their music choices impact their lives and tastes more broadly. Likely just as appealing as gleaning deeper personal insights, though, users could also potentially build AI tools to compare listening habits with their friends.

Anthropic did not immediately respond to Ars Technica's request for comment. In an unusual arrangement showing the tangled alliances of the AI industry, Microsoft will reportedly purchase access to Anthropic's models through Amazon Web Services—both a cloud computing rival and one of Anthropic's major investors.

We have to wait until Friday to tell you how that car drives, but among the changes from the previous generation are door handles that retract flush with the bodywork, for the front doors at least. Car designers love them for not ruining the lines of the door with the necessities of real life, but is the benefit from drag reduction worth the safety risk? That question is in even sharper relief this morning. Bloomberg's Dana Hull hasa deeply reported articlethat looks at the problem of Tesla's door handles, which fail when the cars lose power. The electric vehicle manufacturer chose not to use conventional door locks in its cars, preferring to use IP-based electronic controls. While the front seat occupants have always had a physical latch that can open the door, it took some years for the automaker to add emergency releases for the rear doors, and even now that it has, many rear-seat Tesla passengers will be unaware of where to find or how to operate the emergency release. A power failure also affects first responders' ability to rescue occupants, and Hull's article details a number of tragic fatal crashes where the occupants of a crashed Tesla were unable to escape the smoke and flames of their burning cars. In fact, the styling feature might be on borrowed time. It seems that Chinese authorities have been concerned about retractable door handles for some time now andare reportedly close to banning themfrom 2027. Flush-fit door handles fail far more often during side impacts than regular handles, delaying egress or rescue time after a crash.",

        "description": "Last year,we reportedon the discovery of an intriguing arrow-shaped rock on Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover. The rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. Granted, this was not slam-dunk evidence of past life on Mars, and the results were preliminary, awaiting peer review. But it was an intriguing possibility nonetheless. Now further analysis and peer review are complete, and there is a new paper, published in the journal Nature, reporting on the findings. It's still not definitive proof that there was water-based life on Mars billions of years ago, but the results are consistent with a biosignature. It's just that other non-biological processes would also be consistent with the data, so definitive proof might require analysis of the Martian samples back on Earth. You can watch NASA's livestream briefinghere. \"We have improved our understanding of the geological context of the discovery since [last year], and in the paper, we explore abiotic and biological pathways to the formation of the features that we observe,\" co-author Joel Hurowitz, an astrobiologist at Stony Brook University in New York, told Ars. \"My hope is that this discovery motivates a whole bunch of new research in laboratory and analog field settings on Earth to try to understand what conditions might give rise to the textures and mineral assemblages we've observed.",

        "description": "Flanked by Silicon Valley’s most powerful executives in the White House last week, Melania Trump hailed artificial intelligence as potentially “the greatest engine of progress in the history of the United States of America.” Less than a mile from the first lady, in a hotel ballroom packed with MAGA faithful, top Republican Josh Hawley had a different message. AI “threatens the common man’s liberty” and could even undermine the Republic itself, the senior US senator from Missouri said. “The problem with the AI revolution as it’s currently going is that it only entrenches the power of the people who are already the most powerful people in the world,” he said. “The goal is to replace... the farmer, the assembly line man, the construction worker.” Hawley is a frequent critic of Big Tech. But his comments are endorsed by a growing chorus on America’s right—even as President Donald Trump’s administration scraps regulatory barriers and accelerates AI’s adoption across the land. It presages an unexpected clash at the heart of the MAGA world. Evangelical pastors, political strategists, and academics gathered at the recent National Conservatism Conference—the MAGA movement’s ideological nerve center—were full of contempt for the technology. “There’s a lot of people who are basically worried about... what actually is going to happen to unemployment and families and the culture and education with advanced AI, even if it doesn’t make it to artificial superintelligence,” said Geoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist who spoke on a panel at the conference.",

        "description": "Leading Internet companies and publishers—including Reddit, Yahoo, Quora, Medium, The Daily Beast, Fastly, and more—think there may finally be a solution to endAI crawlers hammering websitesto scrape content without permission or compensation. Announced Wednesday morning, the \"Really Simply Licensing\" (RSL) standard evolves robots.txt instructions by adding an automated licensing layer that's designed to block bots that don't fairly compensate creators for content. Free for any publisher to use starting today, the RSL standard is an open, decentralized protocol that makes clear to AI crawlers and agents the terms for licensing, usage, and compensation of any content used to train AI, a press release noted. The standard was created by theRSL Collective, which was founded by Doug Leeds, former CEO of Ask.com, and Eckart Walther, a former Yahoo vice president of products and co-creator of the RSS standard, which made it easy to syndicate content across the web. Based on the \"Really Simply Syndication\" (RSS) standard, RSL terms can be applied to protect any digital content, including webpages, books, videos, and datasets. The new standard supports \"a range of licensing, usage, and royalty models, including free, attribution, subscription, pay-per-crawl (publishers get compensated every time an AI application crawls their content), and pay-per-inference (publishers get compensated every time an AI application uses their content to generate a response),\" the press release said. Leeds told Ars that the idea to use the RSS \"playbook\" to roll out the RSL standard arose after he invited Walther to speak to University of California, Berkeley students at the end of last year. That's when the longtime friends with search backgrounds began pondering how AI had changed the search industry, as publishers today are forced to compete with AI outputs referencing their own contentas search traffic nosedives. Eckart had watched the RSS standard quickly become adopted by millions of site...",

        "description": "Apple's most famous chips are the A- and M-series processors that power its iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but this year, its effort to build its own wireless chips is starting to bear fruit. Earlier this spring, the iPhone 16e included Apple's C1 modem, furthering Apple's ambitions to shed its dependence on Qualcomm, and today's iPhone Air brought a faster Apple C1X variant, plus something new: the Apple N1, a chip that provides Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support for all of today's new iPhones. Apple didn't dive deep into the capabilities of the N1, or why it had switched from using third-party suppliers (historically, Apple has mostly leaned on Broadcom for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). However, the company's press releases say that it should make Continuity features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop more reliable—these features use Bluetooth for initial communication and then Wi-Fi to establish a high-speed local link between two devices. Other features that use a similar combination of wireless technologies, like using an iPad as an extended Mac display, should also benefit. These aren't Apple's first chips to integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth technology. The Apple Watches rely on W-series chips to provide their Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity; the Apple H1 and H2 chips also provide Bluetooth connectivity for many of Apple's wireless headphones. But this is the first time that Apple has switched to its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip in one of its iPhones, suggesting that the chips have matured enough to provide higher connectivity speeds for more demanding devices. Apple will likely expand the use of the N1 (and other N-series chips) beyond the iPhone soon enough. Macs and iPads are obvious candidates, but the presence of Thread support also suggests that we'll see it in new smart home devices like the Apple TV or HomePod..",

One of the areas India have worked on in the training camps since the Pro League season was to be more proactive in tackling opponents outside the attacking circle. They did just that, being aggressive in 1-vs-1 situations, and when they won the ball back, they broke forward at pace. Sangita Kumari’s speed down the left flank helped with the circle entry and then Lalremsiami’s typically robust ball-control in crowded spaces helped India win the set piece.

In a video call with Kathore, the stranded tourists described the terrifying situation on the ground and requested to be brought home as soon as possible. The increasing violence and the uncertainty of the situation have left the stranded group feeling vulnerable and anxious. Nepal reeled under a serious political crisis on Tuesday as Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned in the face of massive protests for a second day, with the demonstrators storming many government buildings and setting the parliament as well as homes of several high-profile leaders ablaze, a day after 19 people died in violence. The students-led \"Gen Z\" protests that began against a government ban on social media expanded into a larger campaign reflecting growing public criticism of the Oli dispensation and the country's political elite over alleged corruption and apathy towards the common people.

Now, Himanta Biswa Sarma has claimed the report has revealed \"startling facts\" that point to a larger conspiracy undermining India's sovereignty. \"During the course of this exhaustive investigation, the SIT has unearthed startling facts which point towards a larger conspiracy aimed at undermining the sovereignty of our nation,\" he wrote on X. Referring to Mr Gogoi and his wife, the Chief Minister claimed the SIT has established the \"involvement of a British national who is also married to an Indian Member of Parliament in the larger nefarious activities of Pakistan national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh\". The SIT was probing a case registered with the Assam CID against Ali Taqueer Seikh, who works with a climate action group CDKN, which had alleged links with Ms Coulborn, a British national. Earlier, Mr Sarma claimed that Mr Sheikh had reportedly visited India 18 times and that he had initial information which might lead to facts which would be \"startling\". Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha MP has sharply reacted to the allegations and said that Mr Sarma \"has been issuing fabricated statements to hide the large-scale corruption undergoing in his government\". The state Congress president also claimed that CM Sarma would fail to secure his chair in the next Assembly polls as there is huge resentment among the people against the ruling party. \"People have already made up their mind to overthrow the BJP government from power in Assam. The next government will work for the benefits of poor and unemployed people.",

        "description": "Nepal Protest Live Updates:In Nepal, protests against the short-lived social media ban and corruption continued for the third consecutive day on Wednesday, with mobs setting government buildings and politicians' homes on fire. Some leaders, including the Himalayan nation's former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, were attacked as protestors set the country's parliament on fire. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned amid widening criticism of the country's political elite. The president accepted the resignation and appointed Oli to lead a caretaker government until a new one is in place — though it was unclear what power he would wield or even where he was. The resignation appeared to have little effect on the unrest as thousands of protesters remained on the streets late in the day. They blocked roads and vandalised government facilities, while the army helicopters ferried some ministers to safe places. A day earlier, demonstrations led by young people gripped the capital, and police opened fire on the crowds, killing 19 people. The protests were fueled by the government's ban on social media and corruption in the country. The ban was lifted Tuesday, but the protests continued, fueled by rage over the deaths and accusations of political corruption in the nation wedged between China and India. Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah, seen as a frontrunner himself, endorses ex chief justice Sushila Karki for interim PM post.",

The Duke of Sussex, who has been in the UK since Monday for a series of engagements, was seen entering the royal residence in a black car, just over an hour after the king. Charles flew back from Scotland on Wednesday and arrived home in London, sparking speculation in the British press that there would be a long-awaited reunion between the father and son. Harry cut ties with the royal family in 2020 and moved to California. He has not seen his father since flying to the UK to meet the king when he was diagnosed with cancer last year. In May, Harry said that they were not on speaking terms as a result of the multiple court cases he is fighting in the UK as well as accusations against the royal family he has made in explosive television interviews and his memoir. But Charles's younger son said he was hoping for \"reconciliation\" as he did \"not know how much longer my father has\". Harry on Monday visited the grave of his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who died on September 8, 2022, and has several charity events lined up. He had returned to the UK three other times since their last meeting, but had not managed to see his father, including on one occasion when the pair were at different engagements just two miles apart. But on July 9, the king's press secretary and the prince's head of communications were spotted meeting in London.",

        "description": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday said those who investigate must also be probed as it ordered an FIR against former Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar in a two-decade old case, involving allegations of fabrication of documents and criminal intimidation. The case relates to an incident in 2001 when Kumar was posted as a joint director in the CBI and alleges fabrication of documents in a case. The Delhi High Court on March 13, 2019 dismissed the appeals against a 2006 order of its single-judge bench directing FIR against Kumar and then CBI officer Vinod Kumar Pandey. \"It is high time that sometimes those who investigate must also be investigated to keep alive the faith of the public at large in the system,\" a bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and P B Varale said. Upholding an order of the Delhi High court, the top court directed the matter to be investigated by the Delhi Police Special Cell and by an officer not below the ACP rank. \"The offence is alleged to have been committed in the year 2000 and till date the matter had not been allowed to be investigated. It would be dichotomy of justice if such an offence is allowed to go uninvestigated particularly when there is involvement of the officers on deputation to CBI,\" the bench said. The top court underlined the \"cardinal law\" which says justice must not only be done, but must also be seen to be done. It came on record that two different individuals Sheesh Ram Saini and Vijay Kumar Aggarwal filed separate complaints before the police on July 5, 2001 and February 23, 2004, respectively, seeking investigation but no action was taken. While Saini alleged fabrication of documents by Kumar and Pandey, Aggarwal alleged being criminally intimidated by Pandey at Kumar's instance.",

        "description": "In a discovery that could be the closest evidence yet of life beyond Earth, Nasa’s Perseverance Mars rover has collected a rock sample from Jezero Crater that may contain traces of ancient microbial activity. The finding, announced by Nasa in a published paper in Nature, highlights a sample known as “Sapphire Canyon,” drilled from a rock called “Cheyava Falls” in 2024. Scientists say the sample contains potential biosignatures, substances or structures that might have a biological origin but require rigorous testing before any claims about life on Mars can be made. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy hailed the result as “the closest we have ever come to discovering life on Mars,” calling it a groundbreaking milestone in the US space agency’s exploration of the Red Planet. Perseverance encountered the Cheyava Falls outcrop while exploring the Bright Angel formation near Neretva Vallis, a quarter-mile-wide ancient river channel that once fed water into Jezero Crater. Using its PIXL and SHERLOC instruments, the rover detected distinctive chemical and structural features in the sedimentary rocks. The team reported the presence of “leopard spots,” reaction fronts where two iron-rich minerals—vivianite and greigite—appear side by side. On Earth, both minerals are often linked to microbial activity. Vivianite frequently develops in wetlands and decaying organic matter, while some microbes produce greigite through energy-generating reactions. “The combination of chemical compounds we found could have been a rich source of energy for microbial metabolisms,” said lead author Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University.",

However, the US's warning to Qatar, deliberate or not, seemed to be too little, too late. Qatar said the call from America came 10 minutes after the attack began in Doha. \"The call that was received from an American official came during the sound of the explosions,\" Majed al-Ansari, Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, tweeted. The fact the strikes occurred in Qatar, a close ally of the US that has worked to cultivate Trump, only contributed to the sense of betrayal.The Israeli strike in Doha, Qatar (Source: X)It also exposed theNobel Peace Prize-obsessed Trump's double game. The Israeli attack came as Hamas's political leadership gathered in Doha to discuss the latest US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza after Trump's \"last warning\" to agree a deal.

The trigger was simple – good-quality groceries, fresh produce, and premium packaged foods shouldn’t be a luxury restricted to thetop 30 Mn households. Instead, it had to be democratised to a much wider consumer base. While the former Cleartrip CEO found an increasing demand for better quality products delivered in time, he also realised that the available options were either too costly or too scarce. FirstClub entered India’s$8.82 Bn online grocery marketto hitch a ride on the 44.9% momentum of the industry with a single, persistent question: how can high-quality products across multiple categories be made available in one place, without making them prohibitively expensive? “Whenever I travelled abroad, I noticed that even simple products like fruits, veggies, dry fruits and breads were made with very good ingredients, without any artificial stuff. That concept didn’t exist in India, and my quest was to solve that,” he said.",

Noting how the maintenance work is unavoidable, in a press release issued, the museum stated, “The buildings are in poor condition, requiring substantial investments to keep them safe and suitable for public access. Most technical installations have reached the end of their operational lifespan, are conceptionally outdated, and increasingly difficult to maintain due to a lack of spare parts. As a result, ongoing maintenance is no longer feasible, and the systems must be replaced.”.",

Arundhati Roy, 63, was not raised inside that fable. Her mother, Mary Roy — gender rights advocate, educationist, founder of Kottayam’s feted Pallikoodam school — was a woman who reshaped the inheritance rights of Syrian Christian women in Kerala, transformed the lives of legions of young boys and girls with lessons in equality and self-reliance, and built a formidable life for herself out of very little. But to her two children, Roy and her brother Lalith Kumar Christopher, she was less mother, more Mrs Roy, headmistress and distant guardian, the woman who taught them to pick their way across a minefield of shifting moods and exacting expectations, and whose love arrived like a brief clearing in otherwise turbulent weather..",

For Batman, it was witnessing a murder in the alleys of Gotham, for Spiderman it was getting bitten by a radioactive spider. For Pushpamala N’s Phantom Lady, it was walking on the hallowed grounds of what was to be Mannat, the now widely popular residence of superstar Shah Rukh Khan. In hindsight, it was meant to be. Pushpamala had always been a big film buff. Inspired by Fearless Nadia’s ‘Hunterwali’ look, she created the Phantom Lady or Kismet for the first time in 1996 – dressing up in a black mask, cape and a hat – for a photograph meant for submission to a film festival. “It was supposed to be one photograph,” she says during a telephonic interview. Pushpamala never sent in the submission but as she looked at the photographs clicked at SRK’s bungalow, then known as Villa Vienna, she knew she “wanted to expand this and make it into an exhibition”. Finally, she created a photo-romance series with 25 black-and-white photos, shot across different locations inMumbai..",

The director sat down for a conversation with Baradwaj Ragan, where he revealed that the script of the movie has been drafted, and shooting will begin next month, with Mohanlal playing the lead. During the conversation with the podcast host, the filmmaker also shared that it took him five drafts to complete the script, as the initial ones weren’t approved by his daughters. Joseph assured the audience that would be different from the first two parts but also warned that fans might be disappointed if they expect a high-intelligence game like the second film. Jeethu Joseph reflects on the progress of Drishyam 3 The filmmaker, while speaking to Ragan, revealed that he is sure the third installment of Drishyam would be liked by the audience. Joseph revealed, “I am happy with Drishyam 1 and 2, and Drishyam 3 is going to be a good film. I don’t know about the box office thing, but I approached the character growth organically, not considering as an actor, but I considered him as George Kutty, and whatever changes can happen after four years, that’s where I am working on.” The director also talked about the script, revealing that it is complete. He added, “It’s fully done.” Jeethu went on to state that his daughters did not like the first script. Recalling the incident, the director shared, “I had a Europe trip in April, so while travelling I wrote the screenplay, and on the Amsterdam to Dubai flight, I finished the scene order. After that I came here, and I had this shoot of Valadvista Kalan, so every morning I woke up at 3:30, wrote two or three scenes, and that’s how you complete it. It was a pretty hectic thing.” The ace director revealed that while writing the scenes, he got another idea and went away from the first line. He added that he completed the script and gave it to his daughters. “After the first half, I met them, I discussed, and then they read the second half. So once that process was done, I asked my cameraman and editor that the four of us read the script, and they had some suggestions; there were some issues, so it’s always like that.” Later, Joseph reworked the second draft, then the third, and it went up to five drafts. Speaking of the fans’ expectations from the movie, the filmmaker claimed that if “the audiences are expecting a heavy intelligence game like Drishyam 2, then they will be disappointed.” Further details about the release date of the movie will be rolled out soon.

        "description": "In what is being called the biggest ever acquisition for a book, Legendary has bought the movie rights to SenLinYu's novel, ALCHEMISED, for a whopping 3 million USD. The seven figure purchase comes as an undeniable offer to the writer of the book and is meant to deter any competitors from trying their hand to grab the win. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, SenLinYu spoke about the acquisition, “I’m honored by Legendary’s incredible enthusiasm for the project and can’t wait to see the world of Paladia come to life.” SenLinYu's novel presents romance between Harry Potter’s beloved characters The original fan-fic, ALCHEMISED, followed a forbidden love story between Gryffindor’s Hermione Granger ( ) and Slytherin’s Draco Malfoy ( ), however it is not known just how much of the JK Rowling characters would be continued or carried forward in the film adaptation. It is unlikely that many similarities between the two fictional worlds will continue owing to the copyright issues at hand. ALCHEMISED is based in the Dramonie side of the fan fiction world which follows the aces from the two opposing houses at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It runs over their unlikely love arc, and was first shared on the ‘fan-created, fan-run, nonprofit, noncommercial archive’ AO3 (Archive Of Our Own). The deal made for ALCHEMISED is believed to be the biggest ever for a new book's movie rights, not counting the inflation rates. It will probably set precedent for its successors as more releases and novel-to-movie adaptations become the norm. SenLinYu’s other popular AO3 works include a Harry Potter X Handmaiden’s Tale fan fic called Manacled with over 10 million views and another Star Wars work which followed Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and Rey. They will join many popular fan fictions being adapted into films including Fifty Shades of Grey, After series, and more, which have garnered millions of views across the globe.

They are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is also essential for various bodily functions, including heart health, brain development, and immune system function. However, unlike other vitamin supplements, the effects of omega-3 supplementation may take some time to become noticeable in your body. We spoke to a health expert to understand why.

Biscuits promised it, chips boasted it, even bottled water claimed to carry it. Scroll through Instagram, and it’s the same story – endless reels of protein pancakes, protein coffees, protein bowls. Somehow, a nutrient that once sat quietly in the food pyramid has turned into a lifestyle statement. The numbers back it up, too. The global protein supplements market is valued at over $25 billion and continues to grow by nearly eight per cent every year, according toFortune. In India, where traditional diets are often carb-heavy, surveys by the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), under the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), show that seven out of 10 Indians are not meeting theirdaily protein needs. And yet, in urban pockets, protein has become the holy grail of health, marketed as the fix for everything from weight loss to better skin..",

Then hear what celebrity macrobiotic coach Dr Shilpa Arora is suggesting: that returning to the age-old Indian toilet system might be the key to unlocking good health and a longer lifespan. During a conversation with host Bishal Pall on The Indians Podcast, Dr Arora said that back in the day, houses used to have a bathroom far away and people used to have to walk to use the loo. “That would give them a walking exercise first. Next, when you are sitting down, your leg muscles get worked. You would not get PCOD, your periods would regularise, and your organs would begin healing. We have forgotten all this now,” she elaborated..",

Most people don’t start their careers knowing exactly what they are passionate about. Even if they think they do, that passion often evolves or fades over time. Anchoring big life decisions to a single, often vague idea can lead to frustration and guilt. If you are lucky enough to have a clear passion at 20 and it stays consistent at 40, that’s wonderful.

It all unfolded on the third ball of the 13th over as UAE's Junaid Siddique went for a wild swing offShivam Dube's short-pitched ball. India wicketkeeperSanju Samsonshowed great presence of mind to effect a direct throw as Junaid was out of his crease. The decision was referred to the third umpire and the replays showed that Junaid's foot was out of the popping crease. The \"OUT\" sign flashed on the big screen, but the batter was quick to argue that Dube's towel had fallen while he was running in. India captain Suryakumar obliged as he chose to withdraw the appeal. The decision didn't really help UAE as they were bowled out for a paltry total of 57 a few balls later. Uae player Junaid forgets to get into the crease and sanju rans out himThen suray comes and withdraws his appealBut very soon in the next balls he gets caught to suryapic.twitter.com/esiewrahWu Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav didn't show any signs of rustiness while running through a clueless UAE batting line-up. Kuldeep, who had a frustrating time in the UK after warming the bench for five straight Tests, was too skillful for the UAE batters to comprehend, ending with figures of 4 for 7 in 2.1 overs.Jasprit Bumrah (1/19 in 3 overs) started the slide with a perfect yorker to remove Kerala born Alishan Sharafu (22 off 17 balls), who had till then survived audaciously with three boundaries and a six.

In an ironic twist, it was left-arm spinnerSimranjeet Singh, who once bowled to Shubman in his pre-teens, that was hit for the winning runs by the Indian vice-captain. India's batting effort was more like a highlights package and a glorified net session, with UAE bowlers having very little clue about where to pitch the ball. India took just 27 balls to win the match, making it one of the shortest-ever T20Is. India won the match with 93 balls to spare, an Asian record. Before this, Sri Lanka held the record for most balls to spare by an Asian Full Member team, having won with 90 balls to spare against the Netherlands in 2014. Winning with the most balls to spare by a Full Member team: Previous most by India: 81 balls vs Scotland, Dubai, 2021 It was clear the match would end well before time once captainSuryakumar Yadavwon the toss and elected to field. The bowling plans laid out byGautam Gambhirand Suryakumar were perfectly executed by the unit, with the Dubai track aiding the skillful Indian spinners. Kuldeep, who had a frustrating time in the UK after warming the bench for five straight Tests, was too good for the UAE batters, ending with figures of 4 for 7 in 2.1 overs.",

Consumers will ask if this is a larger iPhone or a cheaper iPhone Pro. But when compared to basic iPhones, this has just one camera, though the price is more than the regular iPhone. Then this will be catering to those who want a more powerful and slim device, but are not really too bothered by its camera capabilities..",

Since its launch, YouTube reports that several testers have seen success with this feature. On average, those who uploaded multi-language audio tracks saw over 25% of their watch time coming from views in the video’s non-primary language. Jamie Oliver’s channel, for instance, tripled in views after using multi-language audio tracks. Additionally, the company has been testing multi-language thumbnails with a select group of creators. Since June, creators have been able to customize thumbnails to display text in other languages, catering to their international audience.",

        "description": "If you’ve heard of Arc Boats, the Los Angeles startup founded in 2021 by former SpaceX employees, it’s likely because you’ve seen itssleek sport boats. But the company’s also been pushing into the far less glamorous world of tugboats, and now has its first big order worth $160 million. The company announced Wednesday it has signed a contract of that value with Curtin Maritime, a tug and barge operator. The new hybrid-electric tugs are expected to hit the waters around the Los Angeles port in 2027. Curtin has ordered eight tugs — at around $20 million apiece — and Arc will build them in conjunction with Snow & Co. shipyard. Specifically, these are what’s known as ship-assist tugboats, which help nudge behemoth cargo ships into and out of major ports like Los Angeles. Arc CEO and co-founder Mitch Lee told TechCrunch these kinds of tugboats are “torque generating machines, which is really cool.” But the standard versions are powered by monster diesel engines that “just spew black carbon, [and] spew sulfur oxides” into the air, damaging the surrounding environment and risking the long-term health of the crews who work them. Lee said these kinds of tugs are some of the worst-polluting vehicles on the planet by linear foot. By largely replacing the diesel power plants with batteries and electric motors — more on the hybrid system in a moment — Arc can help tugboat operators cut down on that pollution.",

The new app features a series of new tools that allow parents to manage their children’s activity on the console, including an activity report, greater visibility into what their children are playing, and the ability to approve extra playtime requests. While Sony has long offered parental controls, the new app brings all of these tools into one dedicated place for easier access while also adding new ones. With the new app, parents get notified what game their child is playing in real-time and can approve or decline a child’s request for extra playing time or restricted games. They can also set time limits for each day of the week. The app’s daily and weekly reports allow parents to see how much time they’re spending on the console and which games they played the most. Additionally, the app’s content filters let parents configure age-appropriate content. Sony notes that there are presets that automatically apply recommended settings for different age groups, and that these settings can be customized to each child. Parents can also customize privacy settings and manage access to social features. Plus, they can manage spending activity by adding funds, viewing balances, and setting a monthly spending limit.",

Korea actually started the match on the front foot, attacking down the left flank. One of the areas India have worked on in the training camps since the Pro League season was to be more proactive in tackling opponents outside the attacking circle. They did just that, being aggressive in 1-vs-1 situations, and when they won the ball back, they broke forward at pace. Sangita Kumari’s speed down the left flank helped with the circle entry and then Lalremsiami’s typically robust ball-control in crowded spaces helped India win the set piece. After struggling with PC conversions in the back end of the big win against Singapore, there was bound to be some intrigue as to how India tackled the PC routines..",

He occasionally plays in classical leagues abroad and slightly more frequently competes in rapid events like the Global Chess League. “In general I think that if you look at the changes in the chess time control, the ratings system, historically relative to how the world has advanced, I think it’s time for, I think first of all you need rating decay.

Trump's Commerce Department rewrote the rules of the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program, forcing states to change how they spend money earmarked for expanding broadband access. The overhaul led states to reduce spending on fiber networks and increase spending on satellite—although not to the extent sought by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who isdemanding more moneyfor his Starlink network. Since states are spending less on deployment, and the program still has the $42 billion allocated by Congress, what happens to the leftover amount after money is spent on deploying broadband networks? Amid speculation that the Trump administration wants to return that money to the US Treasury, Louisiana's Republican governor is worried that states won't be able to use the full $42 billion. It's possible that half or more of the $42 billion won't be used to expand broadband. \"As the first state to submit our Final Proposal ahead of the September 4th deadline, we respectfully request that you continue to hew closely to the statute by directing that remaining BEAD allocations be invested in state-led initiatives, subject to NTIA [National Telecommunications and Information Administration] review, that advance the following key national priorities,\" Landry wrote in aMonday letterto Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. TheUS lawthat created BEAD is clear that the money can be used for more than sending subsidies to Internet service providers. The \"key national priorities\" specifically cited in Landry's letter were Trump's \"AI Action Plan\" along with Trump's \"America First\" and \"Make America Great Again\" plans for investing in education, workforce training, and growing US industries. Landry's letter praised Lutnick's overhaul of BEAD, stating that \"you have delivered in only a few months what the Biden NTIA failed to deliver in over three ...",

NPR oncebroke downexactly why our brains find the feature so \"irresistible,\" while Cosmopolitan last yeardeclaredthat sharing Wrapped screenshots of top artists and songs had by now become \"the ultimate status symbol\" for tens of millions of music fans. It's no surprise then that, after a decade, some Spotify users who are especially eager to see Wrapped evolve are no longer willing to wait to see if Spotify will ever deliver the more creative streaming insights they crave. With the help of AI, these users expect that their data can be more quickly analyzed to potentially uncover overlooked or never-considered patterns that could offer even more insights into what their listening habits say about them. Imagine, for example, accessing a music recap that encapsulates a user's full listening history—not just their top songs and artists. With that unlocked, users could track emotional patterns, analyzing how their music tastes reflected their moods over time and perhaps helping them adjust their listening habits to better cope with stress or major life events. And for users particularly intrigued by their own data, there's even the potential to use AI to cross data streams from different platforms and perhaps understand even more about how their music choices impact their lives and tastes more broadly. Likely just as appealing as gleaning deeper personal insights, though, users could also potentially build AI tools to compare listening habits with their friends. That could lead to nearly endless fun for the most invested music fans, where AI could be tapped to assess all kinds of random data points, like whose breakup playlists are more intense or who really spends the most time listening to a shared favorite artist.

The shift reportedly follows internal testing that revealed Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 model excels at specific Office tasks where OpenAI's models fall short, particularly in visual design and spreadsheet automation, according to sources familiar with the project cited by The Information, who stressed the move is not a negotiating tactic. Anthropic did not immediately respond to Ars Technica's request for comment. In an unusual arrangement showing the tangled alliances of the AI industry, Microsoft will reportedly purchase access to Anthropic's models through Amazon Web Services—both a cloud computing rival and one of Anthropic's major investors. The integration is expected to be announced within weeks, with subscription pricing for Office's AI tools remaining unchanged, the report says. Microsoft maintains that its OpenAI relationship remains intact. \"As we've said, OpenAI will continue to be our partner on frontier models and we remain committed to our long-term partnership,\" a Microsoft spokespersontold Reutersfollowing the report. The tech giant has poured over $13 billion into OpenAI to date and is currently negotiating terms for continued access to OpenAI's models amidongoing negotiationsabout their partnership terms. Stretching back to 2019, Microsoft's tight partnership with OpenAIuntil recentlygave the tech giant a head start in AI assistants based on language models, allowing for a rapid (thoughbumpy) deployment of OpenAI-technology-based features in Bing search and the rollout of Copilot assistants throughout its software ecosystem.

We have to wait until Friday to tell you how that car drives, but among the changes from the previous generation are door handles that retract flush with the bodywork, for the front doors at least. Car designers love them for not ruining the lines of the door with the necessities of real life, but is the benefit from drag reduction worth the safety risk? That question is in even sharper relief this morning. Bloomberg's Dana Hull hasa deeply reported articlethat looks at the problem of Tesla's door handles, which fail when the cars lose power. The electric vehicle manufacturer chose not to use conventional door locks in its cars, preferring to use IP-based electronic controls. While the front seat occupants have always had a physical latch that can open the door, it took some years for the automaker to add emergency releases for the rear doors, and even now that it has, many rear-seat Tesla passengers will be unaware of where to find or how to operate the emergency release. A power failure also affects first responders' ability to rescue occupants, and Hull's article details a number of tragic fatal crashes where the occupants of a crashed Tesla were unable to escape the smoke and flames of their burning cars. In fact, the styling feature might be on borrowed time. It seems that Chinese authorities have been concerned about retractable door handles for some time now andare reportedly close to banning themfrom 2027. Flush-fit door handles fail far more often during side impacts than regular handles, delaying egress or rescue time after a crash.",

The rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. Granted, this was not slam-dunk evidence of past life on Mars, and the results were preliminary, awaiting peer review. But it was an intriguing possibility nonetheless. Now further analysis and peer review are complete, and there is a new paper, published in the journal Nature, reporting on the findings. It's still not definitive proof that there was water-based life on Mars billions of years ago, but the results are consistent with a biosignature. It's just that other non-biological processes would also be consistent with the data, so definitive proof might require analysis of the Martian samples back on Earth. You can watch NASA's livestream briefinghere. \"We have improved our understanding of the geological context of the discovery since [last year], and in the paper, we explore abiotic and biological pathways to the formation of the features that we observe,\" co-author Joel Hurowitz, an astrobiologist at Stony Brook University in New York, told Ars. \"My hope is that this discovery motivates a whole bunch of new research in laboratory and analog field settings on Earth to try to understand what conditions might give rise to the textures and mineral assemblages we've observed.",

        "description": "Flanked by Silicon Valley’s most powerful executives in the White House last week, Melania Trump hailed artificial intelligence as potentially “the greatest engine of progress in the history of the United States of America.” Less than a mile from the first lady, in a hotel ballroom packed with MAGA faithful, top Republican Josh Hawley had a different message. AI “threatens the common man’s liberty” and could even undermine the Republic itself, the senior US senator from Missouri said. “The problem with the AI revolution as it’s currently going is that it only entrenches the power of the people who are already the most powerful people in the world,” he said. “The goal is to replace... the farmer, the assembly line man, the construction worker.” Hawley is a frequent critic of Big Tech. But his comments are endorsed by a growing chorus on America’s right—even as President Donald Trump’s administration scraps regulatory barriers and accelerates AI’s adoption across the land. It presages an unexpected clash at the heart of the MAGA world. Evangelical pastors, political strategists, and academics gathered at the recent National Conservatism Conference—the MAGA movement’s ideological nerve center—were full of contempt for the technology. “There’s a lot of people who are basically worried about... what actually is going to happen to unemployment and families and the culture and education with advanced AI, even if it doesn’t make it to artificial superintelligence,” said Geoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist who spoke on a panel at the conference.",

        "description": "Leading Internet companies and publishers—including Reddit, Yahoo, Quora, Medium, The Daily Beast, Fastly, and more—think there may finally be a solution to endAI crawlers hammering websitesto scrape content without permission or compensation. Announced Wednesday morning, the \"Really Simply Licensing\" (RSL) standard evolves robots.txt instructions by adding an automated licensing layer that's designed to block bots that don't fairly compensate creators for content. Free for any publisher to use starting today, the RSL standard is an open, decentralized protocol that makes clear to AI crawlers and agents the terms for licensing, usage, and compensation of any content used to train AI, a press release noted. The standard was created by theRSL Collective, which was founded by Doug Leeds, former CEO of Ask.com, and Eckart Walther, a former Yahoo vice president of products and co-creator of the RSS standard, which made it easy to syndicate content across the web. Based on the \"Really Simply Syndication\" (RSS) standard, RSL terms can be applied to protect any digital content, including webpages, books, videos, and datasets. The new standard supports \"a range of licensing, usage, and royalty models, including free, attribution, subscription, pay-per-crawl (publishers get compensated every time an AI application crawls their content), and pay-per-inference (publishers get compensated every time an AI application uses their content to generate a response),\" the press release said. Leeds told Ars that the idea to use the RSS \"playbook\" to roll out the RSL standard arose after he invited Walther to speak to University of California, Berkeley students at the end of last year. That's when the longtime friends with search backgrounds began pondering how AI had changed the search industry, as publishers today are forced to compete with AI outputs referencing their own contentas search traffic nosedives. Eckart had watched the RSS standard quickly become adopted by millions of site...",

        "description": "Apple's most famous chips are the A- and M-series processors that power its iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but this year, its effort to build its own wireless chips is starting to bear fruit. Earlier this spring, the iPhone 16e included Apple's C1 modem, furthering Apple's ambitions to shed its dependence on Qualcomm, and today's iPhone Air brought a faster Apple C1X variant, plus something new: the Apple N1, a chip that provides Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support for all of today's new iPhones. Apple didn't dive deep into the capabilities of the N1, or why it had switched from using third-party suppliers (historically, Apple has mostly leaned on Broadcom for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). However, the company's press releases say that it should make Continuity features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop more reliable—these features use Bluetooth for initial communication and then Wi-Fi to establish a high-speed local link between two devices. Other features that use a similar combination of wireless technologies, like using an iPad as an extended Mac display, should also benefit. These aren't Apple's first chips to integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth technology. The Apple Watches rely on W-series chips to provide their Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity; the Apple H1 and H2 chips also provide Bluetooth connectivity for many of Apple's wireless headphones. But this is the first time that Apple has switched to its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip in one of its iPhones, suggesting that the chips have matured enough to provide higher connectivity speeds for more demanding devices. Apple will likely expand the use of the N1 (and other N-series chips) beyond the iPhone soon enough. Macs and iPads are obvious candidates, but the presence of Thread support also suggests that we'll see it in new smart home devices like the Apple TV or HomePod..",

Referring to Mr Gogoi and his wife, the Chief Minister claimed the SIT has established the \"involvement of a British national who is also married to an Indian Member of Parliament in the larger nefarious activities of Pakistan national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh\". The SIT was probing a case registered with the Assam CID against Ali Taqueer Seikh, who works with a climate action group CDKN, which had alleged links with Ms Coulborn, a British national. Earlier, Mr Sarma claimed that Mr Sheikh had reportedly visited India 18 times and that he had initial information which might lead to facts which would be \"startling\". Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha MP has sharply reacted to the allegations and said that Mr Sarma \"has been issuing fabricated statements to hide the large-scale corruption undergoing in his government\". The state Congress president also claimed that CM Sarma would fail to secure his chair in the next Assembly polls as there is huge resentment among the people against the ruling party. \"People have already made up their mind to overthrow the BJP government from power in Assam.

Some leaders, including the Himalayan nation's former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, were attacked as protestors set the country's parliament on fire. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned amid widening criticism of the country's political elite. The president accepted the resignation and appointed Oli to lead a caretaker government until a new one is in place — though it was unclear what power he would wield or even where he was. The resignation appeared to have little effect on the unrest as thousands of protesters remained on the streets late in the day. They blocked roads and vandalised government facilities, while the army helicopters ferried some ministers to safe places. A day earlier, demonstrations led by young people gripped the capital, and police opened fire on the crowds, killing 19 people. The protests were fueled by the government's ban on social media and corruption in the country. The ban was lifted Tuesday, but the protests continued, fueled by rage over the deaths and accusations of political corruption in the nation wedged between China and India.

Charles flew back from Scotland on Wednesday and arrived home in London, sparking speculation in the British press that there would be a long-awaited reunion between the father and son. Harry cut ties with the royal family in 2020 and moved to California. He has not seen his father since flying to the UK to meet the king when he was diagnosed with cancer last year. In May, Harry said that they were not on speaking terms as a result of the multiple court cases he is fighting in the UK as well as accusations against the royal family he has made in explosive television interviews and his memoir. But Charles's younger son said he was hoping for \"reconciliation\" as he did \"not know how much longer my father has\". Harry on Monday visited the grave of his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who died on September 8, 2022, and has several charity events lined up. He had returned to the UK three other times since their last meeting, but had not managed to see his father, including on one occasion when the pair were at different engagements just two miles apart.

The case relates to an incident in 2001 when Kumar was posted as a joint director in the CBI and alleges fabrication of documents in a case. The Delhi High Court on March 13, 2019 dismissed the appeals against a 2006 order of its single-judge bench directing FIR against Kumar and then CBI officer Vinod Kumar Pandey. \"It is high time that sometimes those who investigate must also be investigated to keep alive the faith of the public at large in the system,\" a bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and P B Varale said. Upholding an order of the Delhi High court, the top court directed the matter to be investigated by the Delhi Police Special Cell and by an officer not below the ACP rank. \"The offence is alleged to have been committed in the year 2000 and till date the matter had not been allowed to be investigated. It would be dichotomy of justice if such an offence is allowed to go uninvestigated particularly when there is involvement of the officers on deputation to CBI,\" the bench said. The top court underlined the \"cardinal law\" which says justice must not only be done, but must also be seen to be done. It came on record that two different individuals Sheesh Ram Saini and Vijay Kumar Aggarwal filed separate complaints before the police on July 5, 2001 and February 23, 2004, respectively, seeking investigation but no action was taken. While Saini alleged fabrication of documents by Kumar and Pandey, Aggarwal alleged being criminally intimidated by Pandey at Kumar's instance.",

Speaking to reporters, a group of protesters said, “We staged a protest against Opposition leader Jitendra Chaudhury with black flags at Ambassa. A few days back, he disrespected risa, which is a traditional legacy of the tribals of the state. This is an insult on all tribals of the state. It is surprising how he could insult risa despite being an indigenous person himself. He has to seek an apology for his disrespect to risa”..",

        "description": "In a discovery that could be the closest evidence yet of life beyond Earth, Nasa’s Perseverance Mars rover has collected a rock sample from Jezero Crater that may contain traces of ancient microbial activity. The finding, announced by Nasa in a published paper in Nature, highlights a sample known as “Sapphire Canyon,” drilled from a rock called “Cheyava Falls” in 2024. Scientists say the sample contains potential biosignatures, substances or structures that might have a biological origin but require rigorous testing before any claims about life on Mars can be made. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy hailed the result as “the closest we have ever come to discovering life on Mars,” calling it a groundbreaking milestone in the US space agency’s exploration of the Red Planet. Perseverance encountered the Cheyava Falls outcrop while exploring the Bright Angel formation near Neretva Vallis, a quarter-mile-wide ancient river channel that once fed water into Jezero Crater. Using its PIXL and SHERLOC instruments, the rover detected distinctive chemical and structural features in the sedimentary rocks. The team reported the presence of “leopard spots,” reaction fronts where two iron-rich minerals—vivianite and greigite—appear side by side. On Earth, both minerals are often linked to microbial activity. Vivianite frequently develops in wetlands and decaying organic matter, while some microbes produce greigite through energy-generating reactions. “The combination of chemical compounds we found could have been a rich source of energy for microbial metabolisms,” said lead author Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University.",

        "description": "Jeethu Joseph is all set to bring Drishyam 3 to the audience in the coming months. The director sat down for a conversation with Baradwaj Ragan, where he revealed that the script of the movie has been drafted, and shooting will begin next month, with Mohanlal playing the lead. During the conversation with the podcast host, the filmmaker also shared that it took him five drafts to complete the script, as the initial ones weren’t approved by his daughters. Joseph assured the audience that would be different from the first two parts but also warned that fans might be disappointed if they expect a high-intelligence game like the second film. Jeethu Joseph reflects on the progress of Drishyam 3 The filmmaker, while speaking to Ragan, revealed that he is sure the third installment of Drishyam would be liked by the audience. Joseph revealed, “I am happy with Drishyam 1 and 2, and Drishyam 3 is going to be a good film. I don’t know about the box office thing, but I approached the character growth organically, not considering as an actor, but I considered him as George Kutty, and whatever changes can happen after four years, that’s where I am working on.” The director also talked about the script, revealing that it is complete. He added, “It’s fully done.” Jeethu went on to state that his daughters did not like the first script. Recalling the incident, the director shared, “I had a Europe trip in April, so while travelling I wrote the screenplay, and on the Amsterdam to Dubai flight, I finished the scene order. After that I came here, and I had this shoot of Valadvista Kalan, so every morning I woke up at 3:30, wrote two or three scenes, and that’s how you complete it. It was a pretty hectic thing.” The ace director revealed that while writing the scenes, he got another idea and went away from the first line. He added that he completed the script and gave it to his daughters. “After the first half, I met them, I discussed, and then they read the second half. So once that process was done, I asked my cameraman and editor that the four of us read the script, and they had some suggestions; there were some issues, so it’s always like that.” Later, Joseph reworked the second draft, then the third, and it went up to five drafts. Speaking of the fans’ expectations from the movie, the filmmaker claimed that if “the audiences are expecting a heavy intelligence game like Drishyam 2, then they will be disappointed.” Further details about the release date of the movie will be rolled out soon.

        "description": "In what is being called the biggest ever acquisition for a book, Legendary has bought the movie rights to SenLinYu's novel, ALCHEMISED, for a whopping 3 million USD. The seven figure purchase comes as an undeniable offer to the writer of the book and is meant to deter any competitors from trying their hand to grab the win. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, SenLinYu spoke about the acquisition, “I’m honored by Legendary’s incredible enthusiasm for the project and can’t wait to see the world of Paladia come to life.” SenLinYu's novel presents romance between Harry Potter’s beloved characters The original fan-fic, ALCHEMISED, followed a forbidden love story between Gryffindor’s Hermione Granger ( ) and Slytherin’s Draco Malfoy ( ), however it is not known just how much of the JK Rowling characters would be continued or carried forward in the film adaptation. It is unlikely that many similarities between the two fictional worlds will continue owing to the copyright issues at hand. ALCHEMISED is based in the Dramonie side of the fan fiction world which follows the aces from the two opposing houses at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It runs over their unlikely love arc, and was first shared on the ‘fan-created, fan-run, nonprofit, noncommercial archive’ AO3 (Archive Of Our Own). The deal made for ALCHEMISED is believed to be the biggest ever for a new book's movie rights, not counting the inflation rates. It will probably set precedent for its successors as more releases and novel-to-movie adaptations become the norm. SenLinYu’s other popular AO3 works include a Harry Potter X Handmaiden’s Tale fan fic called Manacled with over 10 million views and another Star Wars work which followed Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and Rey. They will join many popular fan fictions being adapted into films including Fifty Shades of Grey, After series, and more, which have garnered millions of views across the globe.

Justice Mehta was dictating his judgment in the case against Antulay filed by the Janata leader, P B Samant. One of the last wishes of the slain Akali leader, Harchand Singh Longowal, was the establishment of a Panthic government in Punjab. This was stated by the acting president of the Akali Dal, Surjit Singh Barnala, at the “bhog” ceremony of Longowal. This wish may be fulfilled if the Akali leadership do not leave the path adopted by them now and remain united for the cause of communal harmony and unity, for which Longowal sacrificed his life..",
